Pulse is a symbolic-capital foresight simulator that models emotional overlays, strategic fragility, capital exposure forks, and trust-weighted forecast generation.


---

## 🧬 Project Identity

Pulse is a modular simulation intelligence engine designed for recursive forecasting, retrodiction, and capital/narrative strategy synthesis.
It operates by combining emotional-symbolic overlays, trust scoring, and adaptive rule evolution to generate and validate optimal timelines.  
It's goal is to ingest real-time market, social, political, ecological, etc. data, run monte carlo simulations, state retrodiction, forecast retrodiction, etc. to generate confidence on probabilistic outcomes. 
Memory and trace persistence are core: all simulation cycles are scored, pruned, and iteratively improved.

## 🚀 Quickstart

    cd pulse
    python main.py

- Outputs 5 forecast cycles by default
- Prints Strategos Digest grouped by trust level
- Saves optional `digest.txt` if logging is enabled

## ⚙️ Verbs

All output is emitted as JSON.

- **forecast**: Run forecast cycle  
  Example:
  ```bash
  pulse forecast --start-year 2025 --turns 10
  # => {"result": {...}}
  ```

- **compress**: Compress forecasts  
  Example:
  ```bash
  pulse compress --input-file forecasts.json --output-file compressed.json
  # => {"result": {...}}
  ```

- **retrodict**: Run retrodiction cycle  
  Example:
  ```bash
  pulse retrodict --start-date 2017-01-01 --days 30
  # => {"result": {...}}
  ```

- **train-gpt**: Run GPT training cycle  
  Example:
  ```bash
  pulse train-gpt --dataset-path data/train.json --epochs 5
  # => {"result": {...}}
  ```

- **status**: Generate status report  
  Example:
  ```bash
  pulse status
  # => {"result": {...}}
  ```

- **exit**: Exit the shell  
  Example:
  ```bash
  pulse exit
  # (shell exits)
  ```

  ```
  python -m forecast_output.strategos_digest_builder --from-prompt "AI" --export markdown --output digest.md
  ```
  Use digest templates:
  ```
  python -m forecast_output.strategos_digest_builder --from-prompt "AI" --export markdown --output digest.md --template short
  ```

This is an interpretability-first build: every module is readable, auditable, and designed for modular iteration.

---

## Centralized Configuration

All file paths and key configuration values are now managed in `core/path_registry.py` and `core/pulse_config.py`.  
Modules should import from these files instead of hardcoding paths or constants.

Example:
```python
from core.path_registry import PATHS
from core.pulse_config import CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD
```

---

## Coding Standards

- Use type annotations and docstrings in all new code.
- Shared logic must go in `utils/`.
- Add/maintain tests for each module in `tests/`.
- Use `@profile` from `utils/performance_utils.py` for performance-critical code.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Profiling

- Unit tests for all modules are in `tests/`.
- Use `pytest` to run tests.
- Example:  
  ```
  pytest tests/test_strategos_digest_builder.py
  pytest tests/test_digest_exporter.py
  pytest tests/test_pulse_prompt_logger.py
  pytest tests/test_reverse_rule_engine.py
  pytest tests/test_rule_fingerprint_expander.py
  ```
- Use `@profile` from `utils/performance_utils.py` for performance-critical code.

- **Memory/Diagnostics:** Stores history, runs audits, and prunes memory.
- **UI/CLI:** User interface for running and analyzing simulations.

## Test Coverage & Running Tests

- All core modules have unit and integration tests in `tests/`.
- Property-based tests (using `hypothesis`) are included for complex logic.
- To run all tests and check coverage:

```sh
pytest --cov=.
```

- To run a specific test file:

```sh
pytest tests/test_forecast_memory.py
```
