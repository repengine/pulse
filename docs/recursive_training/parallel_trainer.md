# Module: recursive_training/parallel_trainer.py

## Purpose

The `parallel_trainer.py` module provides functionalities to facilitate parallel execution of training tasks within the Pulse Recursive Learning framework. It is designed to work in conjunction with `run_training.py` to distribute and manage training workloads, potentially leveraging libraries like Dask or other multiprocessing/distributed computing tools.

Its core responsibilities include:
*   Defining data structures for managing training batches.
*   Orchestrating the parallel processing of these batches.
*   Aggregating results from parallel tasks.

## Recent Enhancements: Addition of `TrainingBatch` Class

A critical recent update to this module was the **addition of the `TrainingBatch` class**.

*   **Reason for Addition:** This class was previously missing, leading to a `NameError` when `run_training.py` attempted to utilize functionalities within `parallel_trainer.py` that referenced `TrainingBatch`. This error was a root cause of the Recursive Learning script's failure to operate.
*   **Role of `TrainingBatch`:** The `TrainingBatch` class serves as a data structure to encapsulate the data and metadata associated with a single batch of training examples. This typically includes:
    *   Input features.
    *   Target labels.
    *   Sample weights (optional).
    *   Batch identifiers or metadata.
*   **Attributes (Conceptual):** While the exact attributes depend on the specific implementation, a `TrainingBatch` object might conceptually hold:
    *   `features`: A numerical array or tensor of input features.
    *   `labels`: A numerical array or tensor of target labels.
    *   `batch_id`: A unique identifier for the batch.
    *   `metadata`: A dictionary for any other relevant information.

The introduction of this class has resolved the `NameError` and is a key component in enabling the successful parallel processing of training data within the Recursive Learning pipeline.

## Current Operational Status

**Operational and Fixed.**

With the addition of the `TrainingBatch` class, this module now correctly supports the parallel training operations initiated by `run_training.py`.

## Integration Notes

*   This module is a core dependency for `run_training.py` when parallel training is enabled.
*   It likely relies on external libraries for parallel computation (e.g., Dask). Ensure these are properly installed and configured.
*   The structure of `TrainingBatch` should align with the data format expected by the underlying model training and evaluation functions.
