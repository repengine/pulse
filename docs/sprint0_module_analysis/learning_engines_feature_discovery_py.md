# Module Analysis: `analytics.engines.feature_discovery`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the `analytics.engines.feature_discovery` module is to automatically discover new symbolic tags, variable groupings, or emergent behaviors within datasets. It achieves this by employing clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. The module is also responsible for logging these discoveries into a central learning log and is intended to provide a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for its functionalities.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be in a relatively functional state for its core defined scope.
- It includes Pydantic models ([`FeatureDiscoveryInput`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:18), [`FeatureDiscoveryResult`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:21)) for input and output data validation.
- The main class, [`FeatureDiscoveryEngine`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:28), contains the primary logic within its [`discover_features`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:32) method.
- Basic example usage is provided within an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:77`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:77)).
- No explicit "TODO" comments or obvious major placeholders are present in the code.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Although `PCA` ([`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:10)) and `TSNE` ([`sklearn.manifold.TSNE`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:11)) are imported, they are not currently used in the [`discover_features`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:32) method. This suggests an intention to incorporate these techniques, which remains unimplemented.
- **Populating `features` List:** The `features` list within the [`FeatureDiscoveryResult`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:21) model is initialized as an empty list ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:43`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:43)) but is never populated with any discovered features. This indicates a planned aspect of the output that is currently missing.
- **CLI Development:** The module's docstring mentions providing a "CLI entry point" ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:5`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:5)). The existing `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:77`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:77)) is a basic execution example rather than a fully-fledged CLI. A more robust interface (e.g., using `argparse` or `Typer`) seems to be an intended but incomplete feature.
- **Advanced Error Handling:** Current error handling ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:72-75`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:72-75)) is generic. More specific error types or detailed logging could enhance robustness.
- **Configurability:** Several parameters for feature selection and clustering algorithms are hardcoded (see Section 6).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

-   **[`FeatureDiscoveryEngine`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:28) Class:**
    ```python
    from analytics.engines.feature_discovery import FeatureDiscoveryEngine
    import pandas as pd

    # Sample DataFrame
    data = {
        'feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
        'feature2': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
        'target':   [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    engine = FeatureDiscoveryEngine()
    discovery_results = engine.discover_features(df)
    print(discovery_results)
    ```
-   **[`FeatureDiscoveryInput`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:18) Model:**
    Used internally for validating the input to [`discover_features`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:32).
    ```python
    # Valid input
    FeatureDiscoveryInput(data=df)
    ```
-   **[`FeatureDiscoveryResult`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:21) Model:**
    Used internally for validating the output of [`discover_features`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:32).
    ```python
    # Example structure that would be validated
    sample_output = {
        "status": "success",
        "features": [], # This is currently always empty
        "clusters": {"labels": [0,0,1], "dbscan_labels": [-1,0,0]},
        "top_variables": ["feature1", "feature2"]
    }
    FeatureDiscoveryResult(**sample_output)
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **`SelectKBest` `k` parameter:** The number of top features to select is hardcoded with `k=min(5, X.shape[1])` ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:48`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:48)). This limits selection to a maximum of 5 features, which might not be optimal for all datasets.
-   **`KMeans` `n_clusters` parameter:** The number of clusters for KMeans is determined by `n_clusters=min(3, len(df))` ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:56`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:56)). This limits clustering to a maximum of 3 clusters.
-   **`KMeans` `n_init` parameter:** The `n_init` parameter for `KMeans` is hardcoded to `10` ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:56`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:56)).
-   **`DBSCAN` parameters:** `eps` is hardcoded to `0.5` and `min_samples` to `2` ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:60`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:60)). These parameters are highly sensitive and typically require tuning based on the dataset.
-   **Target column name:** The feature selection logic explicitly checks for a column named `'target'` ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:45`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:45)). This name should ideally be configurable or passed as a parameter.

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **Logging System:** The module is coupled to the `core.pulse_learning_log` module via the `log_learning_event` function ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:64`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:64)). Changes to the logging mechanism or its expected data structure could impact this module.
-   **Input Data Structure:** The [`discover_features`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:32) method expects a Pandas DataFrame. While flexible, the internal logic for feature selection relies on the presence (or absence) of a specific column named `'target'`.
-   **Output Data Structure:** The structure of the dictionary returned by [`discover_features`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:32) is validated by the [`FeatureDiscoveryResult`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:21) Pydantic model. Consumers of this module will expect this specific structure.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   **No Dedicated Test File:** Based on the provided file list, there does not appear to be a corresponding test file (e.g., `tests/learning/engines/test_feature_discovery.py`).
-   **Basic Inline Example:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:77-81`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:77-81)) serves as a rudimentary smoke test or usage example. It does not constitute a comprehensive test suite, lacking assertions, edge case testing, or checks for different input scenarios.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

1.  The [`FeatureDiscoveryEngine`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:28) class encapsulates the feature discovery logic.
2.  Its primary method, [`discover_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame)`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:32), accepts a Pandas DataFrame.
3.  **Input Validation:** The input DataFrame is validated against the [`FeatureDiscoveryInput`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:18) Pydantic model ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:42`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:42)).
4.  **Feature Selection:**
    *   If a column named `'target'` exists in the DataFrame ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:45`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:45)), [`SelectKBest`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:12) with [`mutual_info_regression`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:12) is used to identify the top K (max 5) most informative features ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:46-51`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:46-51)).
    *   Otherwise, all columns from the input DataFrame are considered "top variables" ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:53`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:53)).
5.  **Clustering:**
    *   **KMeans:** If at least two top variables are identified, [`KMeans`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:9) clustering is performed on these variables to assign cluster labels. The number of clusters is `min(3, len(df))` ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:55-58`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:55-58)).
    *   **DBSCAN:** [`DBSCAN`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:9) clustering is also performed on the top variables with hardcoded `eps` and `min_samples` values ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:60-62`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:60-62)).
6.  **Logging:** The discovered top variables and cluster information are logged as a "feature_discovery" event using `log_learning_event` from [`core.pulse_learning_log`](core/pulse_learning_log.py:14) ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:64-68`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:64-68)).
7.  **Output Validation:** The resulting dictionary containing status, features (currently always empty), cluster information, and top variables is validated against the [`FeatureDiscoveryResult`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:21) Pydantic model ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:70`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:70)).
8.  **Return Value:** The validated dictionary is returned.
9.  **Error Handling:** The method includes `try-except` blocks to catch `pydantic.ValidationError` ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:72`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:72)) and other general `Exception`s ([`learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:74`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:74)), returning an error status and message.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   **Classes:** [`FeatureDiscoveryEngine`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:28), [`FeatureDiscoveryInput`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:18), and [`FeatureDiscoveryResult`](learning/engines/feature_discovery.py:21) use PascalCase, adhering to PEP 8.
