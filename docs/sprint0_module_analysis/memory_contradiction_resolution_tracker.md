# SPARC Analysis: memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py

**File Path:** [`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:1)
**Analysis Date:** 2025-05-13

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose (SPARC: Specification)

The primary role of the [`contradiction_resolution_tracker.py`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:1) module is to monitor and record the lifecycle of detected forecast contradictions. It determines whether these contradictions are eventually resolved, persist, or partially align based on subsequent forecast data. 

This tracking is crucial for:
*   Symbolic conflict auditing within the system.
*   Validating rules based on memory and observed outcomes.
*   Adjusting trust scores associated with forecasting components or rules.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be largely functional for its defined scope. It includes capabilities for:
*   Comparing symbolic outcomes of two forecasts.
*   Tracking the resolution status between two identified forecasts.
*   Logging resolution outcomes to a persistent file.
*   Summarizing the overall statistics of resolution outcomes from the log.

The presence of an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:66-70`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:66-70)) with example usage suggests it has been tested at a basic level and is runnable. No major `TODO` comments or obvious placeholder code (like `pass` statements in critical functions) were identified.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **"Reversed" Contradictions:** The module docstring ([`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:4`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:4)) mentions tracking if contradictions were "reversed," but the [`compare_symbolic_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19) function does not explicitly categorize this state. It only returns "‚úÖ Resolved", "‚ÜîÔ∏è Still Contradictory", or "üåÄ Partial Alignment". This might be an unimplemented aspect or an oversight in the comparison logic.
*   **Depth of Comparison:** The comparison in [`compare_symbolic_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19) relies solely on `"arc_label"` and `"symbolic_tag"` from forecast dictionaries. The richness and reliability of this comparison depend heavily on the consistency and detail within the `ForecastMemory` entries. More sophisticated comparison logic might be needed for nuanced resolution tracking.
*   **Error Handling:** Error handling in [`track_resolution`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:32) is minimal (returns `None` if forecasts are not found). More specific exceptions or detailed logging for such cases could improve robustness. The summarization function ([`summarize_resolution_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:53)) uses a broad `except Exception:` ([`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:62`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:62)), which could mask specific parsing issues in the log file.
*   **Advanced Summarization:** The current summarization ([`summarize_resolution_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:53)) provides basic counts. Future extensions could include more advanced analytics, such as trends over time, resolution rates for specific types of contradictions, or identifying frequently persisting contradictions.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports:**
    *   `os`: Standard Python library for OS-level operations like path manipulation ([`os.path.dirname`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:44), [`os.makedirs`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:44), [`os.path.exists`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:54)).
    *   `json`: Standard Python library for JSON serialization and deserialization ([`json.dumps`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:46), [`json.loads`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:60)).
    *   `typing`: Standard Python library for type hinting (`List`, `Dict`, `Tuple`, `Optional`).
    *   [`core.path_registry.PATHS`](core/path_registry.py): Internal project module used to retrieve the configured path for the contradiction resolution log file ([`PATHS.get`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:16)).
    *   [`analytics.forecast_memory.ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py): Internal project module providing access to stored forecast data. Used by [`track_resolution`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:32) to fetch forecasts by trace ID.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   **Data Source:** Relies on [`ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py) to provide forecast data (dictionaries) containing `"arc_label"` and `"symbolic_tag"`.
    *   **File System:** Reads from and writes to a JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) log file. The default path is `logs/contradiction_resolution_log.jsonl`, configurable via `PATHS`.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input (Implicit):** The underlying data store accessed by `ForecastMemory`.
    *   **Output/Input:** The contradiction resolution log file (e.g., [`logs/contradiction_resolution_log.jsonl`](logs/contradiction_resolution_log.jsonl)). This file is written to by [`log_resolution_outcome`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:43) and read by [`summarize_resolution_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:53).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

*   **[`compare_symbolic_outcomes(fc1: Dict, fc2: Dict) -> str`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19):**
    *   **Description:** Compares two forecast dictionaries based on their `"arc_label"` and `"symbolic_tag"` fields to determine if they represent a resolved, still contradictory, or partially aligned state.
    *   **Example:** `status = compare_symbolic_outcomes({"arc_label": "increase", "symbolic_tag": "high_confidence"}, {"arc_label": "increase", "symbolic_tag": "high_confidence"})` would result in `status` being `"‚úÖ Resolved"`.

*   **[`track_resolution(trace_id_1: str, trace_id_2: str, memory: Optional[ForecastMemory] = None) -> Optional[str]`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:32):**
    *   **Description:** Fetches two forecasts by their trace IDs from `ForecastMemory`, compares them using [`compare_symbolic_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19), logs the result, and returns the resolution status.
    *   **Example:** `resolution_status = track_resolution("forecast_id_abc", "forecast_id_xyz", forecast_memory_instance)`

*   **[`log_resolution_outcome(tid1: str, tid2: str, status: str)`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:43):**
    *   **Description:** Appends a JSON entry to the `RESOLUTION_LOG` file, recording the trace IDs of the compared forecasts and their resolution status.
    *   **Example:** `log_resolution_outcome("forecast_id_abc", "forecast_id_xyz", "‚ÜîÔ∏è Still Contradictory")`

*   **[`summarize_resolution_outcomes(path: str = str(RESOLUTION_LOG)) -> Dict[str, int]`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:53):**
    *   **Description:** Reads the resolution log file and returns a dictionary counting the occurrences of each resolution status.
    *   **Example:** `summary = summarize_resolution_outcomes()` might return `{"‚úÖ Resolved": 50, "‚ÜîÔ∏è Still Contradictory": 20, "üåÄ Partial Alignment": 5}`.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues (SPARC Critical)

*   **Default Log File Path:** The global constant `RESOLUTION_LOG` is initialized using `PATHS.get("CONTRADICTION_RESOLUTION_LOG", "logs/contradiction_resolution_log.jsonl")` ([`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:16`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:16)). While it attempts to fetch a configured path, it falls back to the hardcoded string `"logs/contradiction_resolution_log.jsonl"` if the key is not found in `PATHS`. This makes the default behavior reliant on a hardcoded relative path.
*   **Default Dictionary Keys/Values in Comparison:**
    *   In [`compare_symbolic_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19), default values `"unknown"` (for `arc_label`, line 20-21) and `"none"` (for `symbolic_tag`, line 22-23) are hardcoded strings used if the respective keys are missing in the forecast dictionaries. These act as magic strings.
*   **Resolution Status Strings:** The status strings `"‚úÖ Resolved"` ([`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:25`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:25)), `"‚ÜîÔ∏è Still Contradictory"` ([`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:27`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:27)), and `"üåÄ Partial Alignment"` ([`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:29`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:29)) are hardcoded within [`compare_symbolic_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19). These same strings are also hardcoded as keys in the `counts` dictionary within [`summarize_resolution_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:56). This makes changes or additions to status types error-prone as they require modification in multiple locations. Using an Enum or a centralized constant definition would be preferable.
*   **Example Trace IDs:** In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, `"T1"` and `"T2"` are used as example trace IDs ([`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:68`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:68)). This is minor as it's for illustrative/testing purposes but still represents hardcoded example data.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **[`core.path_registry.PATHS`](core/path_registry.py):** The module is coupled to `PATHS` for resolving the log file location. Changes to the `PATHS` API or the specific key `"CONTRADICTION_RESOLUTION_LOG"` could impact the module.
*   **[`analytics.forecast_memory.ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py):** There's a significant coupling with `ForecastMemory`. The [`track_resolution`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:32) function directly depends on its `find_by_trace_id` method and the structure of the forecast dictionaries it returns (specifically, the existence and semantics of `"arc_label"` and `"symbolic_tag"` fields).
*   **Log File Format (`.jsonl`):** The module relies on a specific JSON Lines format for the `RESOLUTION_LOG`. Both [`log_resolution_outcome`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:43) (writer) and [`summarize_resolution_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:53) (reader) must adhere to this implicit schema. Changes to the logged fields or format would require coordinated updates.

## 8. Existing Tests (SPARC Refinement)

*   **No Formal Unit Tests:** The module file itself does not contain any formal unit tests (e.g., using Python's `unittest` framework or `pytest`).
*   **Basic Smoke Test:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:66-70`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:66-70)) provides a very basic script for running parts of the module, which can act as a minimal smoke test. However, it does not cover various scenarios, edge cases, or systematically verify outputs.
*   **Testability Gaps & Concerns:**
    *   The core logic in [`compare_symbolic_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19) lacks tests for different combinations of inputs, including cases where keys might be missing from the forecast dictionaries.
    *   [`track_resolution`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:32) needs testing with mocked `ForecastMemory` to simulate forecasts being found or not found, and to verify interaction with logging.
    *   File operations in [`log_resolution_outcome`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:43) (directory creation, file writing, JSON formatting) are untested.
    *   [`summarize_resolution_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:53) needs tests for scenarios like an empty log file, a non-existent log file, a log file with malformed JSON entries, and a log file with valid entries.
*   **Overall Test Coverage:** Very low. This is a significant area for improvement to ensure reliability and facilitate future refactoring.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow (SPARC Architecture)

*   **High-Level Structure:** The module is procedural, consisting of a set of functions and a global constant for the log file path. It does not define any classes itself but utilizes the `ForecastMemory` class from another module.
*   **Key Functional Components:**
    1.  **Comparison Logic:** [`compare_symbolic_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19) (determines resolution status).
    2.  **Tracking Orchestration:** [`track_resolution`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:32) (coordinates fetching forecasts, comparison, and logging).
    3.  **Persistent Logging:** [`log_resolution_outcome`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:43) (writes resolution data to a file).
    4.  **Data Summarization:** [`summarize_resolution_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:53) (reads log data and aggregates statistics).
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Input: `trace_id_1`, `trace_id_2` (to [`track_resolution`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:32)).
    2.  `ForecastMemory` is queried for forecast data (dictionaries).
    3.  Forecast dictionaries are passed to [`compare_symbolic_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19).
    4.  A status string is returned.
    5.  Trace IDs and status string are passed to [`log_resolution_outcome`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:43).
    6.  A JSON object is created and appended to `RESOLUTION_LOG`.
    7.  For summarization, [`summarize_resolution_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:53) reads `RESOLUTION_LOG`, parses each JSON line, and aggregates counts based on the "status" field.
*   **Control Flow:**
    *   [`track_resolution`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:32) acts as the main entry point for tracking a specific pair of contradictions. It calls other helper functions sequentially.
    *   Conditional logic exists within [`compare_symbolic_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19) to determine the status.
    *   Looping occurs in [`summarize_resolution_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:53) to process each line of the log file.

## 10. Naming Conventions (SPARC Maintainability)

*   **Module Name:** [`contradiction_resolution_tracker.py`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:1) is descriptive and clearly indicates the module's purpose.
*   **Function Names:** Functions like [`compare_symbolic_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19), [`track_resolution`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:32), [`log_resolution_outcome`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:43), and [`summarize_resolution_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:53) are generally clear, follow PEP 8 (snake_case), and accurately reflect their actions.
*   **Variable Names:** Most variable names (e.g., `memory`, `outcome`, `counts`, `trace_id_1`) are clear. Shorter names like `fc1`, `fc2` (forecast 1, forecast 2) and `tid1`, `tid2` (trace ID 1, trace ID 2) are used in limited scopes where their meaning is apparent from context.
*   **Constant Names:** `RESOLUTION_LOG` ([`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:16`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:16)) follows PEP 8 for constants (uppercase with underscores).
*   **Docstrings:** A module-level docstring ([`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:1-8`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:1-8)) clearly outlines the purpose and author. Functions generally lack detailed docstrings explaining parameters, return values, and potential exceptions, which would improve maintainability.
*   **Comments:** The code is sparsely commented, relying on clear naming and structure. The "Author: Pulse v0.41" comment is present.
*   **Potential AI Assumption Errors:** The module's reliance on specific keys (`"arc_label"`, `"symbolic_tag"`) within the forecast dictionaries obtained from `ForecastMemory` is an implicit contract. Without a clearly defined schema or interface for these dictionaries within this module's context, AI agents or other developers might make incorrect assumptions about their presence, type, or valid values.

## 11. SPARC Compliance Summary

*   **Specification:**
    *   **Adherence:** Good. The module's purpose is well-defined in its docstring, and the implemented functions directly support this purpose.
    *   **Gaps:** The docstring mentions tracking "reversed" contradictions, which is not explicitly implemented in the comparison logic.

*   **Modularity/Architecture:**
    *   **Adherence:** Fair. The module is focused on a specific task (contradiction resolution tracking) and is organized as a set of related functions.
    *   **Concerns:** It has direct dependencies on `core.path_registry` and `analytics.forecast_memory`, making it moderately coupled. The architecture is simple and procedural.

*   **Refinement Focus:**
    *   **Testability:**
        *   **Adherence:** Poor. There are no formal unit tests. This is a critical area for improvement.
        *   **Recommendations:** Implement comprehensive unit tests for all functions, covering various scenarios and edge cases. Mock external dependencies like `ForecastMemory` and file system operations.
    *   **Security:**
        *   **Adherence:** Good. No hardcoded secrets like API keys or credentials were found. File operations appear safe.
        *   **Concerns:** The default hardcoded log path (`"logs/contradiction_resolution_log.jsonl"`) could be a minor concern if the `logs/` directory is not properly secured in the deployment environment, but this is an operational detail rather than an inherent code vulnerability.
    *   **Maintainability:**
        *   **Adherence:** Fair to Good. Naming conventions are generally good and follow PEP 8. Code clarity is reasonable.
        *   **Concerns:** Lack of detailed function docstrings. Hardcoding of status strings and default values (magic strings) reduces maintainability and makes future changes more error-prone.

*   **No Hardcoding (SPARC Critical Requirement):**
    *   **Violations:**
        1.  The default fallback path for `RESOLUTION_LOG` ([`memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:16`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:16)) is hardcoded.
        2.  Status strings (e.g., `"‚úÖ Resolved"`) are hardcoded in [`compare_symbolic_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19) and [`summarize_resolution_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:53).
        3.  Default values (`"unknown"`, `"none"`) used in [`compare_symbolic_outcomes`](memory/contradiction_resolution_tracker.py:19) are hardcoded magic strings.
    *   **Impact:** These instances make the module less flexible and more difficult to update or configure without code changes.

**Overall SPARC Assessment:**
The module provides a functional implementation for tracking contradiction resolutions. It aligns well with the **Specification** aspect of SPARC. However, it falls short in **Refinement**, particularly concerning **Testability** (lack of unit tests) and adherence to the **No Hardcoding** principle for status strings and default paths/values. The **Modularity** is acceptable, though dependencies could be managed more abstractly in a larger system. Addressing these points, especially by introducing robust tests and refactoring hardcoded elements into configurations or constants/enums, would significantly improve its SPARC compliance and overall quality.
