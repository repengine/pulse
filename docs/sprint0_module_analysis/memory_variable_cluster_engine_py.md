# Analysis Report: `memory/variable_cluster_engine.py`

**Version:** As of Pulse v0.38 (mentioned in module docstring)
**Analyzed On:** 2025-05-17

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py) module is to cluster simulation variables into interpretable groups. This clustering is based on criteria such as variable domain, symbolic tags, and historical trust performance (via fragility and certification ratios).

The module is intended to be used for:
- Analyzing the structure of the worldstate.
- Summarizing scenarios.
- Aiding in drift detection by providing volatility scores for clusters.
- Pruning variables in meta-learning processes.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

- The module appears largely functional for its defined scope.
- It implements clustering by domain ([`cluster_by_domain()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:28)) and by tag ([`cluster_by_tag()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:45)).
- It calculates cluster volatility using data from [`VariablePerformanceTracker`](../../../memory/variable_performance_tracker.py:) ([`score_cluster_volatility()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:61)).
- It provides a summary function ([`summarize_clusters()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:99)).
- Basic logging is implemented.
- Contains an inline test function ([`test_variable_cluster_engine()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:119)) and a `__main__` block for direct execution and output.
- No explicit TODOs or major incomplete sections are visible in the current code. Default values (e.g., `0.5` for volatility components) are used for robustness in case of missing data.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Correlation-based Clustering:** The module docstring mentions clustering based on "correlation," but there's no explicit function or mechanism for this. It might be an intended future enhancement or implicitly handled elsewhere.
- **Advanced Clustering Algorithms:** Current clustering is primarily by predefined metadata (domain, tags). More sophisticated algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical) could be added for dynamic clustering.
- **Drift Detection/Meta-Learning Integration:** While the module is "used for" drift detection and meta-learning pruning, it primarily provides data (cluster summaries and volatility). Direct integration or specific functions for these purposes are not part of this module.
- **Volatility Metrics:** The current volatility score is a simple average. More complex or configurable metrics could be developed.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Project Module Imports:
-   [`core.variable_registry.VARIABLE_REGISTRY`](../../../core/variable_registry.py:): Central source for all variable metadata (types, tags). Accessed in [`cluster_by_domain()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:39) and [`cluster_by_tag()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:58).
-   [`analytics.variable_performance_tracker.VariablePerformanceTracker`](../../../memory/variable_performance_tracker.py:): Used by [`score_cluster_volatility()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:71) to fetch variable effectiveness scores (fragility, certified ratio).

### External Library Dependencies:
-   `json` ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:16`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:16)): Imported but not directly used in the provided code.
-   `os` ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:17`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:17)): Used in `__main__` to check the `PULSE_TEST` environment variable ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:151`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:151)).
-   `logging` ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:18`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:18)): Standard Python logging.
-   `collections.defaultdict` ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:19`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:19)): Used in [`cluster_by_domain()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:35).
-   `typing` (Dict, List, Tuple, Any) ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:20`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:20)): For type hinting.

### Shared Data Interactions:
-   Relies heavily on the structure and content of [`VARIABLE_REGISTRY`](../../../core/variable_registry.py:), expecting specific keys like `"type"` and `"tags"` in variable metadata.
-   Depends on the output format of [`VariablePerformanceTracker.score_variable_effectiveness()`](../../../memory/variable_performance_tracker.py:), expecting keys like `"avg_fragility"` and `"certified_ratio"`.

### Input/Output Files:
-   No direct file I/O for core logic, apart from standard logging.
-   The `__main__` block prints summaries to standard output.
-   Reads the `PULSE_TEST` environment variable to control test execution.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

(No classes are defined in this module.)

-   **[`cluster_by_domain()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:28):**
    ```python
    # Example:
    # from analytics.variable_cluster_engine import cluster_by_domain
    # domain_clusters = cluster_by_domain()
    # print(domain_clusters)
    # Output might be: {'economic': ['gdp_usa', 'interest_rate'], 'social': ['population_density']}
    ```

-   **[`cluster_by_tag(tag: str)`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:45):**
    ```python
    # Example:
    # from analytics.variable_cluster_engine import cluster_by_tag
    # financial_vars = cluster_by_tag("financial_indicator")
    # print(financial_vars)
    # Output might be: ['gdp_usa', 'stock_price_xyz']
    ```

-   **[`score_cluster_volatility(cluster: List[str])`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:61):**
    ```python
    # Example:
    # from analytics.variable_cluster_engine import score_cluster_volatility
    # economic_vars = ['gdp_usa', 'interest_rate']
    # volatility = score_cluster_volatility(economic_vars)
    # print(f"Volatility of economic cluster: {volatility}")
    # Output might be: Volatility of economic cluster: 0.2875
    ```

-   **[`summarize_clusters()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:99):**
    The `__main__` block ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:138`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:138)) demonstrates its usage:
    ```python
    # clusters = summarize_clusters()
    # for c in clusters:
    #     print(f"\nðŸ“¦ Cluster: {c['cluster']}  (size: {c['size']})")
    #     print(f"Volatility Score: {c['volatility_score']}")
    #     # ... and prints variables
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **Default Numerical Values:** The value `0.5` is used as a default for `avg_fragility`, `certified_ratio`, and overall volatility scores in [`score_cluster_volatility()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:61) (e.g., lines [`76`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:76), [`80`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:80), [`88`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:88), [`95`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:95)). While providing robustness, these could potentially be made configurable.
-   **Metadata Keys (Strings):**
    -   In [`VARIABLE_REGISTRY`](../../../core/variable_registry.py:): `"type"` ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:40`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:40)), `"unknown"` (default domain, [`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:40`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:40)), `"tags"` ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:58`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:58)).
    -   In scores from [`VariablePerformanceTracker`](../../../memory/variable_performance_tracker.py:): `"avg_fragility"` ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:88`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:88)), `"certified_ratio"` ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:89`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:89)).
    These string literals define the expected structure of external data.
-   **Environment Variable:** `"PULSE_TEST"` and its values `"0"`/`"1"` ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:151`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:151)) for controlling test execution. This is a common pattern.
-   **Logging Configuration:** `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:24`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:24)) sets a fixed logging level.

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **High Coupling with [`core.variable_registry.VARIABLE_REGISTRY`](../../../core/variable_registry.py:):** The module's core functionality depends entirely on the existence and assumed schema (keys like `"type"`, `"tags"`) of this registry.
-   **High Coupling with [`analytics.variable_performance_tracker.VariablePerformanceTracker`](../../../memory/variable_performance_tracker.py:):** Relies on the `score_variable_effectiveness()` method and the structure of the dictionary it returns (keys like `"avg_fragility"`, `"certified_ratio"`).
-   **Implicit Schema:** The expected structure of variable metadata and performance scores is an implicit contract. Changes in these external structures would break this module.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   An inline test function, [`test_variable_cluster_engine()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:119), is present.
-   **Nature of Tests:** These are basic sanity checks and integration tests for the module's functions, verifying return types and basic behavior. They are not isolated unit tests with mocks for external dependencies like [`VARIABLE_REGISTRY`](../../../core/variable_registry.py:) or [`VariablePerformanceTracker`](../../../memory/variable_performance_tracker.py:).
-   **Test Execution:** Tests are run if the `PULSE_TEST` environment variable is set to `"1"` ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:151`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:151)).
-   **Coverage:** Coverage is limited to the module's own logic flow with live dependencies. Edge cases or behavior with malformed external data are not extensively tested beyond basic error logging (e.g., if [`VARIABLE_REGISTRY`](../../../core/variable_registry.py:) is not a dict).
-   No separate test file (e.g., `tests/test_memory_variable_cluster_engine.py`) was indicated or found in the provided file listing.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

1.  **Initialization:** Imports dependencies and sets up logging.
2.  **Data Access:** Functions primarily access variable metadata from the global [`VARIABLE_REGISTRY`](../../../core/variable_registry.py:).
3.  **Clustering Functions:**
    -   [`cluster_by_domain()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:28): Groups variables based on the `"type"` field in their metadata.
    -   [`cluster_by_tag()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:45): Filters variables based on the presence of a specific tag in their `"tags"` list.
4.  **Volatility Scoring ([`score_cluster_volatility()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:61)):**
    -   Instantiates [`VariablePerformanceTracker`](../../../memory/variable_performance_tracker.py:).
    -   Retrieves effectiveness scores (fragility, certified ratio) for all variables.
    -   Calculates an average volatility for a given list of variables (a cluster) using the formula: `(fragility + (1 - certified_ratio)) / 2`.
    -   Includes error handling for missing scores or unexpected data types.
5.  **Summary Generation ([`summarize_clusters()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:99)):**
    -   Combines the above: first clusters variables by domain.
    -   Then, for each domain cluster, calculates its volatility.
    -   Produces a sorted list of dictionaries, each detailing a cluster's name, members, size, and volatility score.
6.  **Main Execution / Test:**
    -   The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:138`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:138)) runs [`summarize_clusters()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:99) and prints a formatted output.
    -   Optionally runs [`test_variable_cluster_engine()`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:119) based on an environment variable.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   **Functions & Variables:** Generally follow PEP 8 `snake_case` (e.g., [`cluster_by_domain`](../../../memory/variable_cluster_engine.py:28), `volatility_score`).
-   **Constants:** Imported [`VARIABLE_REGISTRY`](../../../core/variable_registry.py:) is `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. `logger` is lowercase, standard for log instances.
-   **Module Name:** `variable_cluster_engine.py` is `snake_case`.
-   **Clarity:** Names are generally descriptive and understandable (e.g., `score_cluster_volatility`, `summarize_clusters`).
-   **Consistency:** Naming is consistent within the module.
-   No significant deviations from Python standards or potential AI assumption errors in naming were observed.
