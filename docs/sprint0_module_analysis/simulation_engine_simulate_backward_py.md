# Analysis Report for simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py`](simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py) module is to perform backward simulation, also known as retrodiction. It achieves this by loading a historical world state snapshot and iteratively stepping backward in time, primarily by inverting a simple decay process for overlay values.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operationally functional for its currently defined, limited scope. It successfully loads a state and simulates backward steps. However, it contains a significant stub:
*   The `retrodiction_score` calculation is explicitly marked as a stub and returns `0.0` ([`simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:59`](simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:59)).

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Retrodiction Scoring:** The most obvious gap is the lack of implementation for `retrodiction_score` ([`simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:59`](simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:59)). The comment `# Stub: compute retrodiction score (mean absolute error) - implement actual logic` indicates this is a planned feature.
*   **Simplistic Decay Inversion:** The current method for stepping backward involves a very simple inversion of decay: `prior_value = value * (1 + DEFAULT_DECAY_RATE)` ([`simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:46`](simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:46)). A more robust system might require more sophisticated, rule-based, or model-based logic for retrodiction, especially if forward simulation involves more complex processes than simple decay.
*   **Lack of Complex Retrodiction Logic:** The module does not incorporate any complex rules or models for determining previous states beyond the simple decay inversion. It was likely intended to be more extensive, possibly integrating with a reverse rule engine or more sophisticated state transition models.
*   **Configuration for Decay:** The `DEFAULT_DECAY_RATE` is hardcoded. A more flexible system would allow this to be configured, potentially on a per-variable or per-overlay basis.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Project Imports:**
    *   [`from intelligence.worldstate_loader import load_historical_snapshot`](intelligence/worldstate_loader.py:10)
    *   [`from engine.worldstate import WorldState`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:11)
*   **Standard Library Dependencies:**
    *   `typing` (Dict, Any, List)
    *   `datetime`
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   None are directly imported or apparent from the code.
*   **Interaction via Shared Data:**
    *   Loads historical snapshots via [`load_historical_snapshot()`](intelligence/worldstate_loader.py:10:0), implying interaction with a data store (e.g., files, database) where these snapshots are persisted. The format and location are abstracted by the loader function.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** Implicitly reads historical snapshot data through [`load_historical_snapshot()`](intelligence/worldstate_loader.py:10:0).
    *   **Output:** The function returns a dictionary in memory containing the `retrodicted_states` and `retrodiction_score`. It does not directly write to log files or other data files.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module contains one primary function: [`run_retrodiction()`](simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:15:0).

```python
from datetime import datetime
from engine.simulate_backward import run_retrodiction

# Assuming a historical snapshot exists for '2023-01-01T12:00:00'
snapshot_datetime = datetime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)
number_of_backward_steps = 10

retrodiction_results = run_retrodiction(
    snapshot_time=snapshot_datetime,
    steps=number_of_backward_steps
)

print("Retrodicted States:")
for state_info in retrodiction_results["retrodicted_states"]:
    print(f"  Step: {state_info['step']}, Overlays: {state_info['overlays']}")

print(f"Retrodiction Score (Stubbed): {retrodiction_results['retrodiction_score']}")
```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **`DEFAULT_DECAY_RATE`**: The decay rate is hardcoded as `0.01` ([`simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:13`](simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:13)). This should ideally be configurable, perhaps globally or even per variable type if the simulation becomes more complex.
*   **Rounding Precision**: The delta calculation uses a hardcoded rounding precision of `4` decimal places: `round(prior_value - value, 4)` ([`simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:48`](simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:48)). This could be made configurable if necessary.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **`WorldState` Structure:** The module is tightly coupled to the structure of the `WorldState` object, specifically how overlays are accessed (e.g., `state.overlays.as_dict()` or `state.overlays.items()`). Changes to `WorldState`'s overlay representation could break this module.
*   **`load_historical_snapshot`:** Relies heavily on the [`load_historical_snapshot()`](intelligence/worldstate_loader.py:10:0) function from the [`intelligence.worldstate_loader`](intelligence/worldstate_loader.py) module. Any changes to the signature or behavior of this loader function could impact this module.
*   **Decay Inversion Logic:** The specific method of inverting decay (`value * (1 + DEFAULT_DECAY_RATE)`) is a core part of its logic. If other modules implement different forward state change mechanisms (beyond simple decay), this retrodiction module would not be able to correctly reverse them without modification.

## 8. Existing Tests

The presence and nature of tests would need to be verified by checking for a corresponding test file, such as `tests/simulation_engine/test_simulate_backward.py`. Based on the code alone:
*   Given the stubbed `retrodiction_score`, comprehensive tests for the accuracy of retrodiction are likely missing or would be testing against a placeholder value.
*   Tests for the basic mechanics of stepping backward (correct number of steps, structure of returned data) could exist.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module defines a single public function, [`run_retrodiction()`](simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:15:0).

**Control Flow:**
1.  The [`run_retrodiction()`](simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:15:0) function is called with a `snapshot_time` and the number of `steps` to simulate backward.
2.  It loads a historical `WorldState` object for the given `snapshot_time` using [`load_historical_snapshot()`](intelligence/worldstate_loader.py:10:0).
3.  It extracts the `current_overlays` (a dictionary of variable names to float values) from the loaded `WorldState`. It handles cases where `state.overlays` might be a dataclass with an `as_dict` method or a simple dictionary-like object.
4.  It initializes an empty list, `retrodicted_states`, to store the results of each backward step.
5.  It then enters a loop that runs for the specified number of `steps`:
    a.  For each `key` and `value` in the `current_overlays`:
        i.  It calculates the `prior_value` by "inverting" a decay process: `prior_value = value * (1 + DEFAULT_DECAY_RATE)`. This assumes the value in the previous step was higher and decayed to the current value.
        ii. The difference (`prior_value - value`) is stored as a delta.
        iii. The `prior_value` is stored in `previous_overlays`.
    b.  A dictionary containing the step number, a copy of `previous_overlays`, and the calculated `deltas` is appended to `retrodicted_states`.
    c.  `current_overlays` is updated to `previous_overlays` to prepare for the next backward step.
6.  After the loop, a `retrodiction_score` is set to a stubbed value of `0.0`.
7.  Finally, it returns a dictionary containing the list of `retrodicted_states` and the `retrodiction_score`.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Functions:** [`run_retrodiction()`](simulation_engine/simulate_backward.py:15:0) uses `snake_case`, which is consistent with PEP 8.
*   **Variables:** Variables like `snapshot_time`, `current_overlays`, `previous_overlays`, `retrodicted_states`, and `deltas` use `snake_case` and are descriptive.
*   **Constants:** `DEFAULT_DECAY_RATE` uses `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, which is standard for constants.
*   **Type Hinting:** The module uses type hints (e.g., `Dict`, `Any`, `List`, `datetime`, `WorldState`), which improves readability and maintainability.
*   Overall, the naming conventions appear consistent with PEP 8 and are clear. No obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations from common Python standards are noted.
