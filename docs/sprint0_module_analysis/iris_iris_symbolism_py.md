# Module Analysis: `iris/iris_symbolism.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`iris/iris_symbolism.py`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:) module is to perform symbolic tagging of input signals. It maps textual signal names or descriptions into predefined symbolic categories such as "hope," "despair," "rage," and "fatigue." This is achieved through a combination of simple heuristic string matching and, if available, a zero-shot classification model from the `transformers` library.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operationally functional for its defined scope.
- It successfully implements both heuristic and optional zero-shot tagging.
- A fallback mechanism to a "neutral" tag is in place if no specific symbol can be inferred or if the zero-shot model fails.
- The zero-shot model ([`facebook/bart-large-mnli`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:23)) is treated as an optional enhancement, with the module gracefully degrading to heuristic-only mode if the model is unavailable.
- No explicit `TODO` comments or obvious placeholders for core functionality were observed.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Limited Symbolic Categories:** The current list of [`SYMBOLIC_CATEGORIES`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:18) (`"hope"`, `"despair"`, `"rage"`, `"fatigue"`) is small and hardcoded. The module could be enhanced by:
    - Allowing these categories to be configurable (e.g., via a configuration file or an external registry).
    - Expanding the default set of categories to cover a wider range of symbolic meanings.
- **Basic Heuristics:** The heuristic matching is a simple substring check ([`iris/iris_symbolism.py:49`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:49)). More sophisticated heuristic rules (e.g., using regular expressions, keyword weighting, or synonym lists) could improve accuracy and flexibility.
- **Fixed Zero-Shot Threshold:** The confidence threshold for the zero-shot model is hardcoded to `0.5` ([`iris/iris_symbolism.py:57`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:57)). This might not be optimal for all signals or symbolic categories. Making this threshold configurable or dynamically adjusted could be beneficial.
- **Zero-Shot Model Choice:** The specific zero-shot model ([`facebook/bart-large-mnli`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:23)) is hardcoded. Allowing configuration of different or fine-tuned zero-shot models could be a future enhancement.
- **"Neutral" Tag Ambiguity:** The fallback tag `"neutral"` ([`iris/iris_symbolism.py:62`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:62)) is generic. Depending on the application, more specific or nuanced fallback categories might be needed.
- **Lack of Extensibility for Tagging Logic:** Adding new tagging strategies currently requires modifying the module's code. A plugin-based architecture or a strategy pattern could make it easier to extend the tagging capabilities.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

- **Direct Project Module Imports:** None observed in this specific file. It is designed to be a utility module likely imported and used by other parts of the `iris` system or broader application that deal with signal processing or interpretation.
- **External Library Dependencies:**
    - `logging` (Python standard library): Used for logging warnings, especially regarding the zero-shot model's availability or failures.
    - `typing` (Python standard library): Used for type hinting ([`Optional`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:13), [`List`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:13)).
    - `transformers` (Hugging Face): Optional dependency for the zero-shot classification pipeline ([`pipeline`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:22)). If not installed or if the model fails to load, the module falls back to heuristic tagging.
- **Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data:**
    - The module itself does not directly interact with files, databases, or message queues. It operates on string inputs (signal names) and returns string outputs (symbolic tags).
    - It is expected that other modules would call its methods, passing signal data and receiving symbolic tags.
- **Input/Output Files:**
    - **Input:** Takes signal names (strings) as input to the [`infer_symbolic_tag`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:35) method.
    - **Output:** Returns symbolic category labels (strings).
    - **Logs:** Writes warning messages using the `logging` module (e.g., if the zero-shot model is unavailable or inference fails).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

### Class: `IrisSymbolismTagger`

```python
from ingestion.iris_symbolism import IrisSymbolismTagger

# Initialize the tagger
tagger = IrisSymbolismTagger()

# Example 1: Inferring a tag using heuristics
signal1_name = "market shows signs of hope and recovery"
symbol1 = tagger.infer_symbolic_tag(signal1_name)
print(f"Signal: '{signal1_name}' -> Symbol: '{symbol1}'") # Expected: hope

# Example 2: Inferring a tag (may use zero-shot if "despair" isn't a direct substring and model is available)
signal2_name = "economic downturn leads to widespread sadness"
symbol2 = tagger.infer_symbolic_tag(signal2_name)
print(f"Signal: '{signal2_name}' -> Symbol: '{symbol2}'") # Expected: despair (potentially via zero-shot) or neutral

# Example 3: Signal with no clear heuristic match
signal3_name = "unexpected system alert"
symbol3 = tagger.infer_symbolic_tag(signal3_name)
print(f"Signal: '{signal3_name}' -> Symbol: '{symbol3}'") # Expected: neutral (or a zero-shot classification)

# Example 4: Listing available symbols
available_symbols = tagger.list_available_symbols()
print(f"Available symbolic categories: {available_symbols}")
# Expected: ['hope', 'despair', 'rage', 'fatigue']
```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

- **Symbolic Categories:** The list [`SYMBOLIC_CATEGORIES`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:18) (`["hope", "despair", "rage", "fatigue"]`) is hardcoded. This limits flexibility and makes it difficult to extend or customize the symbolic vocabulary without code changes.
- **Zero-Shot Model Identifier:** The model name `"facebook/bart-large-mnli"` for the zero-shot pipeline is hardcoded ([`iris/iris_symbolism.py:23`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:23)).
- **Zero-Shot Confidence Threshold:** The value `0.5` used as a confidence threshold for accepting a zero-shot classification result is a magic number ([`iris/iris_symbolism.py:57`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:57)).
- **Fallback Tag:** The default fallback tag `"neutral"` is hardcoded ([`iris/iris_symbolism.py:62`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:62)).

## 7. Coupling Points

- **External Library (Optional):** The module has an optional coupling with the `transformers` library. If this library is not present or the specified model cannot be loaded, the zero-shot functionality is disabled.
- **Consuming Modules:** Modules that use [`IrisSymbolismTagger`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:28) will be coupled to the specific set of symbolic tags it produces (i.e., the hardcoded [`SYMBOLIC_CATEGORIES`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:18) plus `"neutral"`). Changes to these categories could impact downstream logic.
- **Heuristic Logic:** The effectiveness of the heuristic matching is tightly coupled to the phrasing of input signal names and the simplicity of the substring check.

## 8. Existing Tests

Based on the provided file listing for the `tests/` directory, there does not appear to be a dedicated test file for `iris_symbolism.py` (e.g., `tests/test_iris_symbolism.py` or `tests/iris/test_iris_symbolism.py`).

**Assessment:**
- **Coverage:** Likely none or very low if not tested elsewhere.
- **Nature of Tests:** Unknown.
- **Gaps:** A dedicated test suite is needed to cover:
    - Heuristic tagging logic for various inputs (matches, non-matches).
    - Zero-shot tagging (if possible to mock the pipeline or if integration tests are run).
    - Fallback behavior to "neutral".
    - Handling of empty or unusual signal names.
    - Correctness of [`list_available_symbols()`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:64).
    - Behavior when the zero-shot model is unavailable or fails during inference.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module is structured around a single class, [`IrisSymbolismTagger`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:28).

**Initialization Flow:**
1.  A global `logger` instance is created.
2.  A global list, [`SYMBOLIC_CATEGORIES`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:18), defines the core set of symbols.
3.  An attempt is made to initialize a `zero_shot_pipeline` using `transformers.pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")`.
    - If successful, `zero_shot_pipeline` holds the model instance.
    - If an exception occurs (e.g., `transformers` not installed, model not found), `zero_shot_pipeline` is set to `None`, and a warning is logged.

**[`IrisSymbolismTagger`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:28) Class:**
-   **`__init__(self)`:**
    -   Stores the global [`SYMBOLIC_CATEGORIES`](iris/iris_symbolism.py:18) into an instance variable `self.symbols`.
-   **`infer_symbolic_tag(self, signal_name: str) -> str`:**
    1.  Converts the input `signal_name` to lowercase.
    2.  **Heuristic Match:** Iterates through `self.symbols`. If a symbol is found as a substring in `name_lower`, that symbol is returned immediately.
    3.  **Zero-Shot Fallback (if no heuristic match and model is available):**
        -   Checks if `zero_shot_pipeline` is not `None`.
        -   Calls `zero_shot_pipeline` with `signal_name` and `self.symbols`.
        -   If the result is a dictionary containing "labels" and "scores", and the top score (`result["scores"][0]`) is greater than `0.5`, the corresponding label (`result["labels"][0]`) is returned.
        -   If any exception occurs during zero-shot inference, a warning is logged.
    4.  **Final Fallback:** If no symbol is returned by the above steps, the string `"neutral"` is returned.
-   **`list_available_symbols(self) -> List[str]`:**
    -   Returns the instance variable `self.symbols`.
