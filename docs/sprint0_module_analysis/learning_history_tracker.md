# Analysis Report: `learning/history_tracker.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`learning/history_tracker.py`](learning/history_tracker.py:1) module is to log the evolution of variables across simulation steps. It takes a series of simulation state snapshots and records the variables from each snapshot into a structured JSONL file. This supports introspection, graphing, and creating a long-term memory of Pulse foresight activity.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its stated purpose. It can:
*   Take a `run_id` and a list of `state_snapshots`.
*   Create an output directory if it doesn't exist.
*   Write each state's variables to a `.jsonl` file, with each line representing a step and its corresponding variables.
*   Handle basic error conditions such as invalid input types for snapshots or missing 'variables' keys.
*   Includes basic print statements for success and failure messages.

There are no obvious placeholders or TODO comments in the code.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **No signs of being more extensive:** The module is quite focused and doesn't show signs of incomplete larger features.
*   **Logical next steps:**
    *   **Data Loading/Parsing:** While it saves data, there's no corresponding function in this module to load or parse these `.jsonl` files. This would be a logical next step for any module intending to use this historical data for analysis, graphing, or feeding into long-term memory.
    *   **Advanced Configuration:** Configuration for logging (e.g., logging frequency, specific variables to track, different output formats) is not present.
    *   **Error Handling & Reporting:** While basic `print` statements are used for warnings and errors, a more robust logging mechanism (e.g., using the `logging` module) or custom error classes could be beneficial for larger applications.
*   **No clear deviations:** Development seems to have followed a clear path for the implemented functionality.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct imports from other project modules:**
    *   None. The usage example `from analytics.history_tracker import track_variable_history` implies it's designed to be imported by other modules within the `learning` package or elsewhere in the project.
*   **External library dependencies:**
    *   `os`: Used for path manipulation ([`os.path.basename()`](learning/history_tracker.py:31), [`os.makedirs()`](learning/history_tracker.py:32), [`os.path.join()`](learning/history_tracker.py:33)).
    *   `json`: Used for serializing dictionary records into JSON strings ([`json.dumps()`](learning/history_tracker.py:50)).
    *   `typing`: Used for type hints (`List`, `Dict`).
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:**
    *   The primary interaction is through the `.jsonl` files it creates in the `history_logs` directory (or a custom specified directory). Other modules would consume these files.
*   **Input/output files:**
    *   **Output:** `history_logs/vars_{run_id}.jsonl` (by default). This file contains the step-by-step variable snapshots.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module contains one primary function:

*   **[`track_variable_history(run_id: str, state_snapshots: List[Dict], output_dir: str = "history_logs")`](learning/history_tracker.py:19):**
    *   **Purpose:** Saves the history of variables from a list of simulation state snapshots to a JSONL file.
    *   **Usage Example (from module docstring):**
        ```python
        from analytics.history_tracker import track_variable_history
        
        # Example state snapshots
        state_snapshots_data = [
            {"variables": {"var1": 10, "var2": "a"}},
            {"variables": {"var1": 12, "var2": "b", "var3": True}},
            {"variables": {"var1": 15, "var2": "c"}}
        ]
        simulation_run_id = "sim_alpha_001"
        
        track_variable_history(simulation_run_id, state_snapshots_data)
        # This would create a file like 'history_logs/vars_sim_alpha_001.jsonl'
        ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Output Directory:** The `output_dir` parameter defaults to `"history_logs"` ([`learning/history_tracker.py:19`](learning/history_tracker.py:19)). While configurable, this is a hardcoded default.
*   **Filename Prefix:** The output filename uses a hardcoded prefix `"vars_"` ([`learning/history_tracker.py:33`](learning/history_tracker.py:33)).
*   **Warning/Error Messages:** The warning and error messages printed to the console are hardcoded strings (e.g., [`"⚠️ Warning: Step {i} is not a valid dictionary. Skipping."`](learning/history_tracker.py:39)).

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Output File Format:** The module is tightly coupled to the JSONL format for output. Any change to this format would require changes in both this module and any consuming modules.
*   **Input Data Structure:** It expects `state_snapshots` to be a list of dictionaries, and each dictionary to contain a key `"variables"` which itself is a dictionary ([`learning/history_tracker.py:41`](learning/history_tracker.py:41), [`learning/history_tracker.py:42`](learning/history_tracker.py:42)). Modules providing this data must adhere to this structure.
*   **File System Interaction:** The module directly interacts with the file system to create directories and write files. This creates a dependency on file system access and structure.

## 8. Existing Tests

A test file [`tests/test_history_tracker.py`](tests/test_history_tracker.py:1) exists and uses the `unittest` framework.

*   **Current State & Coverage:**
    *   The test class [`TestHistoryTracker`](tests/test_history_tracker.py:8) has a `setUp` method to prepare mock states and configuration.
    *   The test method [`test_basic_write_and_structure()`](tests/test_history_tracker.py:18) checks:
        *   If the output file is created.
        *   If the number of lines in the output file matches the number of input states.
        *   If each line is valid JSON and contains the expected "step" and "variables" keys.
        *   If the "step" number is correct.
        *   If "variables" is a dictionary.
    *   A `tearDown` method is present to clean up the created test files and directory.
*   **Nature of Tests:** The existing test covers the basic successful execution path and the structure of the output file.
*   **Obvious Gaps or Problematic Tests:**
    *   **Error Conditions:** Tests for error handling are missing. For example:
        *   What happens if `state_snapshots` contains non-dictionary items? (The code prints a warning and skips, this behavior could be tested).
        *   What happens if a snapshot is missing the `"variables"` key or if its value is not a dictionary? (Again, warnings are printed, behavior could be tested).
        *   What happens if `json.dumps()` fails due to non-serializable data within the variables? (A `TypeError` is caught, and a warning is printed).
        *   What happens if file I/O operations fail (e.g., due to permissions)? (A general `Exception` is caught).
    *   **Directory Traversal Prevention:** The code includes `run_id = os.path.basename(run_id)` ([`learning/history_tracker.py:31`](learning/history_tracker.py:31)) to prevent directory traversal. A test case could specifically check this by providing a `run_id` like `../../evil_id`.
    *   **Custom Output Directory:** Testing with a custom `output_dir` different from the default.

The existing tests are a good start but could be expanded to cover more edge cases and error handling paths.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Structure:** The module consists of a single public function [`track_variable_history()`](learning/history_tracker.py:19).
*   **Key Components:**
    *   Input validation for `state_snapshots`.
    *   Directory and path creation for the output file.
    *   Iteration through `state_snapshots`.
    *   Extraction and validation of the `variables` dictionary from each snapshot.
    *   Serialization of the record (step number and variables) to a JSON string.
    *   Writing the JSON string as a new line in the output `.jsonl` file.
    *   Error handling for type errors during serialization and general exceptions during file writing.
*   **Primary Data/Control Flows:**
    1.  Function [`track_variable_history()`](learning/history_tracker.py:19) is called with `run_id`, `state_snapshots`, and optionally `output_dir`.
    2.  `run_id` is sanitized.
    3.  Output directory is created.
    4.  Output file path is constructed.
    5.  The function attempts to open the file for writing.
    6.  It iterates through each `snapshot` in `state_snapshots`:
        a.  Validates `snapshot` type.
        b.  Retrieves and validates the `variables` dictionary.
        c.  Creates a `record` dictionary containing the current `step` and `variables`.
        d.  Serializes `record` to JSON and writes it to the file, followed by a newline.
        e.  Handles `TypeError` if serialization fails for a record.
    7.  Prints a success message.
    8.  Handles general `Exception` if file writing fails at a higher level.

## 10. Naming Conventions
