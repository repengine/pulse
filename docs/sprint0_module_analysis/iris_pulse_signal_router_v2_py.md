# Module Analysis: `iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py) module is to ingest, tag, and route external signals to the appropriate IRIS Core subsystems. It is responsible for maintaining signal metadata such as timestamp, source, and type. The module interfaces with [`IrisSymbolismTagger`](../../../iris/iris_symbolism.py), [`IrisTrustScorer`](../../../iris/iris_trust.py), and [`IrisArchive`](../../../iris/iris_archive.py) to process and store these signals. It is designed to allow for modular future expansions, including signal clustering, enrichment, and prioritization, as stated in its docstring (lines 4-8).

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operational for its defined scope. The version "0.427A (Corrected)" (line 11) suggests it has undergone revisions and corrections. The core functionalities of routing 'symbolic' and 'trust' signals, along with a fallback for unhandled types, are implemented. There are no explicit `TODO` comments or obvious placeholders in the main logic.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Future Expansions:** The module's docstring (line 8) explicitly mentions "modular future expansions (signal clustering, enrichment, prioritization)." These features are not yet implemented.
*   **Handling More Signal Types:** The [`route_signal`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:45) method has an `else` condition (lines 96-98) that archives signals of unhandled types with a print statement: `"[PulseSignalRouter] Unhandled signal type: {signal_type}. Archived only."` This implies that specific processing logic for additional signal types could be added.
*   **Error Handling in Batch Processing:** The [`batch_route`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:100) method (lines 100-111) catches exceptions for individual signals and prints an error, allowing other signals in the batch to be processed. More sophisticated error reporting or retry mechanisms could be considered.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Project Imports:**
    *   [`ingestion.iris_symbolism.IrisSymbolismTagger`](../../../iris/iris_symbolism.py) (or [`iris_symbolism.IrisSymbolismTagger`](../../../iris/iris_symbolism.py))
    *   [`ingestion.iris_trust.IrisTrustScorer`](../../../iris/iris_trust.py) (or [`iris_trust.IrisTrustScorer`](../../../iris/iris_trust.py))
    *   [`ingestion.iris_archive.IrisArchive`](../../../iris/iris_archive.py) (or [`iris_archive.IrisArchive`](../../../iris/iris_archive.py))
    *   The `try-except ImportError` block (lines 18-25) provides fallback import paths, possibly for different execution environments or local testing.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   `datetime` (from `datetime` module, standard library)
    *   `typing.Dict`, `typing.Any` (from `typing` module, standard library)
*   **Interaction with Other Modules:**
    *   The [`PulseSignalRouter`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:28) class is initialized with instances of [`IrisSymbolismTagger`](../../../iris/iris_symbolism.py), [`IrisTrustScorer`](../../../iris/iris_trust.py), and [`IrisArchive`](../../../iris/iris_archive.py).
    *   It calls methods on these instances:
        *   `symbolism_engine.infer_symbolic_tag()`
        *   `trust_engine.score_recency()`, `trust_engine.detect_anomaly_isolation()`, `trust_engine.compute_signal_trust_index()`
        *   `archive_engine.append_signal()`
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   The module itself does not directly read from or write to files. However, the [`IrisArchive`](../../../iris/iris_archive.py) module, which it interacts with, is responsible for signal storage and likely involves file operations or database interactions.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module includes an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block (lines 115-128) that demonstrates basic usage:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    symbolism = IrisSymbolismTagger()
    trust = IrisTrustScorer()
    archive = IrisArchive()

    router = PulseSignalRouter(symbolism, trust, archive)

    incoming_signal = {
        'type': 'symbolic',
        'payload': 'hope resurgence',
        'source': 'scraper_google_trends'
    }

    router.route_signal(incoming_signal)
```
This example shows how to instantiate [`PulseSignalRouter`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:28) with its dependencies and how to call the [`route_signal`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:45) method with a sample signal.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Signal Type Strings:** The signal types `'symbolic'` (line 75) and `'trust'` (line 80) are hardcoded strings within the [`route_signal`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:45) method. These could potentially be defined as constants or an Enum for better maintainability if the number of types grows.
*   **Default Trust Value:** In the 'trust' signal processing block, `payload.get('value', 0.0)` (line 83) uses a hardcoded default of `0.0` if 'value' is not present in the payload.
*   **Required Keys:** The list `required_keys = ['type', 'payload', 'source']` (line 59) is hardcoded.
*   **Error/Log Messages:** Various print statements and `ValueError` messages contain hardcoded strings (e.g., line 61, line 98, line 111).

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **IRIS Core Subsystems:** The module is tightly coupled to the specific interfaces (method signatures and expected behavior) of [`IrisSymbolismTagger`](../../../iris/iris_symbolism.py), [`IrisTrustScorer`](../../../iris/iris_trust.py), and [`IrisArchive`](../../../iris/iris_archive.py). Changes in these external modules could necessitate changes in [`PulseSignalRouter`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:28).
*   **Signal Dictionary Structure:** The module expects incoming signals to be dictionaries with specific keys (`'type'`, `'payload'`, `'source'`, and optionally `'timestamp'`, `'value'` within payload for trust signals). Any deviation from this structure will lead to errors or incorrect processing.
*   **Timestamp Handling:** The timestamp processing, including `datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()` (line 64, line 84) and `datetime.fromisoformat(timestamp.replace('Z', '+00:00'))` (line 86), assumes specific formats and UTC timezone.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   There is no dedicated test file (e.g., `tests/test_pulse_signal_router_v2.py`) apparent from the provided workspace file list.
*   The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block (lines 115-128) serves as a basic inline execution example or a rudimentary integration test, demonstrating how the [`PulseSignalRouter`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:28) interacts with mock or actual instances of its dependencies. This is not a substitute for a comprehensive test suite.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Class-Based Structure:** The module defines a single class, [`PulseSignalRouter`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:28).
*   **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    *   The constructor (lines 29-43) takes instances of [`IrisSymbolismTagger`](../../../iris/iris_symbolism.py), [`IrisTrustScorer`](../../../iris/iris_trust.py), and [`IrisArchive`](../../../iris/iris_archive.py) as dependencies and stores them as instance attributes.
*   **Signal Routing (`route_signal`)**:
    1.  Validates that the input `signal` dictionary contains required keys (`'type'`, `'payload'`, `'source'`) (lines 59-61).
    2.  Constructs `signal_metadata` including a timestamp (defaults to current UTC time if not provided) and source/type from the input signal (lines 63-67).
    3.  Creates a `signal_record` by merging the original signal with the generated metadata (lines 70-73).
    4.  Converts the `signal['type']` to lowercase for case-insensitive matching (line 69).
    5.  **Conditional Processing based on `signal_type`**:
        *   If `'symbolic'` (lines 75-79):
            *   Calls `self.symbolism_engine.infer_symbolic_tag()` with the signal payload.
            *   Adds the returned `symbolic_tag` to `signal_record`.
            *   Archives the `signal_record` using `self.archive_engine.append_signal()`.
        *   If `'trust'` (lines 80-95):
            *   Extracts `value` and `timestamp` from the payload/signal.
            *   Calls `self.trust_engine.score_recency()`, `self.trust_engine.detect_anomaly_isolation()`, and `self.trust_engine.compute_signal_trust_index()`.
            *   Adds `recency_score`, `anomaly_flag`, and `sti` (Signal Trust Index) to `signal_record`.
            *   Archives the `signal_record`.
        *   Else (unhandled types) (lines 96-98):
            *   Archives the `signal_record` directly.
            *   Prints a message indicating an unhandled signal type.
*   **Batch Routing (`batch_route`)**:
    *   Iterates through a list of signals (lines 100-111).
    *   Calls [`route_signal`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:45) for each signal.
    *   Includes a `try-except` block to catch and print errors during individual signal processing, allowing the batch operation to continue.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Class Name:** [`PulseSignalRouter`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:28) uses PascalCase, which is standard for Python classes.
*   **Method Names:** [`__init__`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:29), [`route_signal`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:45), [`batch_route`](../../../iris/pulse_signal_router_v2.py:100) use snake_case, which is conventional. Dunder methods like `__init__` are correctly named.
*   **Variable Names:** Variables like `symbolism_engine`, `trust_engine`, `signal_metadata`, `signal_type`, `signal_record`, `required_keys` use snake_case, adhering to PEP 8.
*   **Module Name:** `pulse_signal_router_v2.py` uses snake_case.
*   **Constants:** `required_keys` (line 59) is a local variable acting as a constant; PEP 8 suggests `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for module-level constants, but its local scope makes snake_case acceptable.
*   **Overall Consistency:** Naming conventions appear consistent and largely follow PEP 8 guidelines. No obvious AI assumption errors in naming are apparent. The suffix `_v2` in the filename suggests it's a second version of this router.
