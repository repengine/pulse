# Module Analysis: analytics.transforms.rolling_features

## Module Path

[`learning/transforms/rolling_features.py`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:1)

## Purpose & Functionality

The primary purpose of the [`rolling_features.py`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:1) module is to provide functions for generating new features from time-series data using rolling window calculations. These features are crucial for machine learning models to capture trends, seasonality, and other time-dependent patterns.

Currently, the module implements a single function:
*   **[`rolling_mean_feature`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:9):** Calculates the rolling mean (average) of a specified column over a defined window.

It is expected that this module will be expanded to include other common rolling window calculations such as:
*   Rolling standard deviation
*   Rolling minimum/maximum
*   Rolling sum
*   Rolling median
*   Other statistical aggregations (e.g., skewness, kurtosis)

This module is part of the `learning/transforms/` subdirectory, indicating its role in data transformation and feature engineering pipelines within the Pulse application, specifically for preparing data for learning algorithms.

## Key Components / Classes / Functions

*   **[`rolling_mean_feature(df: pd.DataFrame, window: int = 3, column: str = None) -> pd.Series`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:9):**
    *   **Purpose:** Computes the rolling mean for a specified column in a pandas DataFrame.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `df` ([`pd.DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)): The input DataFrame.
        *   `window` (`int`, default: 3): The size of the rolling window.
        *   `column` (`str`, optional): The name of the column to calculate the rolling mean on. If `None`, the first column of the DataFrame is used.
    *   **Returns:** ([`pd.Series`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html)): A pandas Series containing the rolling mean, named as `{column}_rolling_mean_{window}`.
    *   **Behavior:** Uses `min_periods=1` to ensure that calculations are produced even if the window is not full (e.g., at the beginning of the series).

## Dependencies

*   **External Libraries:**
    *   `pandas`: Used for DataFrame and Series manipulation, and for the core `.rolling().mean()` functionality.
*   **Internal Pulse Modules:**
    *   None directly within the module itself, but it's intended to be used by other modules within the `learning` pipeline.

## SPARC Analysis

*   **Specification:**
    *   **Clarity:** The purpose of the existing [`rolling_mean_feature`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:9) function is clear from its name, docstring, and implementation.
    *   **Requirements:** The requirements for this specific function are well-defined. However, the overall module's specification is incomplete as it only contains one type of rolling feature.

*   **Architecture & Modularity:**
    *   **Structure:** The module is currently very simple, containing only one function. This is well-structured for its current limited scope.
    *   **Responsibilities:** The responsibility of the [`rolling_mean_feature`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:9) function is clear and focused. The module itself has a clear responsibility for rolling window feature generation.

*   **Refinement - Testability:**
    *   **Existing Tests:** Yes, tests are present in [`tests/test_rolling_features.py`](tests/test_rolling_features.py:1).
        *   [`TestRollingFeatures.test_rolling_mean_feature_basic`](tests/test_rolling_features.py:6): Tests the basic functionality with default parameters.
        *   [`TestRollingFeatures.test_rolling_mean_feature_column_arg`](tests/test_rolling_features.py:12): Tests the functionality when a specific column is provided.
    *   **Design for Testability:** The function is pure (given the same input, it produces the same output) and relies on standard pandas operations, making it inherently testable. The tests are clear and cover the current functionality.

*   **Refinement - Maintainability:**
    *   **Clarity & Readability:** The code is clear, concise, and easy to understand. Type hints are used, improving readability.
    *   **Documentation:** The [`rolling_mean_feature`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:9) function has a good docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and behavior. The module itself has a brief docstring.

*   **Refinement - Security:**
    *   **Obvious Security Concerns:** No obvious security concerns are present. The module processes data and does not interact with external systems in a way that would typically introduce security vulnerabilities (e.g., no file I/O based on user input, no network requests, no shell command execution).

*   **Refinement - No Hardcoding:**
    *   **Window Sizes:** The `window` parameter is configurable (defaulting to 3), not hardcoded within the logic.
    *   **Aggregation Functions:** The aggregation function (mean) is specific to the current function's purpose. If other rolling features were added, they would likely be separate functions or have configurable aggregation types.
    *   **Column Names:** The `column` parameter allows specifying the target column. If not provided, it defaults to the first column, which is a reasonable default but might be less robust if DataFrame column order is not guaranteed. The output column name is dynamically generated based on the input column and window size.

## Identified Gaps & Areas for Improvement

1.  **Limited Functionality:** The most significant gap is the lack of other common rolling window features (std, min, max, sum, median, etc.). The module's name suggests a broader scope.
2.  **Default Column Selection:** While defaulting to the first column if `column` is `None` is a simple approach, it might be less robust. A more explicit requirement or error handling if no column is specified and the DataFrame has no columns could be considered. However, for typical usage within a pipeline, the column would likely always be specified.
3.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Consider what happens if `window` is non-positive or not an integer. Pandas' `rolling()` method might handle some of this, but explicit checks could be beneficial.
    *   What if the specified `column` does not exist in the DataFrame? Pandas will raise a `KeyError`, which might be acceptable.
4.  **Extensibility:** If many more rolling features are added, a more generic function or class-based approach might become beneficial to reduce code duplication (e.g., a function that takes an aggregation function as an argument).
5.  **Docstrings:** While the function docstring is good, the module-level docstring could be more descriptive about the intended scope and its role in the broader system.

## Overall Assessment & Next Steps

The [`analytics.transforms.rolling_features`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:1) module is currently a minimal but functional starting point for generating rolling window features. The existing [`rolling_mean_feature`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:9) function is well-implemented, clear, and adequately tested for its current scope.

**Quality:**
*   **Code Quality:** High for the existing function.
*   **Test Quality:** Good, covering the existing functionality.
*   **Documentation Quality:** Good for the function; adequate for the module.
*   **Completeness:** Low, given the implied scope of "rolling features."

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Expand Functionality:** Implement additional rolling window feature functions (e.g., `rolling_std_feature`, `rolling_min_feature`, `rolling_max_feature`, `rolling_sum_feature`, `rolling_median_feature`).
2.  **Add Tests:** Create corresponding tests for each new feature function.
3.  **Enhance Module Docstring:** Update the module-level docstring to reflect the expanded scope and its role within the Pulse feature engineering pipeline.
4.  **Consider Extensibility:** Evaluate if a more generic approach is needed as more features are added to avoid code repetition.
5.  **Review Error Handling:** Decide on the desired level of explicit error handling versus relying on pandas' built-in error messages.
