# Module Analysis: iris/iris_utils/historical_data_transformer.py

## Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of this module is to process raw historical data obtained from the ingestion phase ("Phase 2"), transform it into a standardized time series format, and persist it within the [`RecursiveDataStore`](recursive_training/data/data_store.py). It also provides utilities for verifying the integrity of the stored data and generating reports on data coverage.

## Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears functionally complete for its core responsibilities as described in the docstring. It implements the main transformation, storage, verification, and reporting functions, along with a command-line interface. There are no explicit `TODO` comments or obvious placeholders indicating incomplete features within the provided code.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   The data transformation logic ([`transform_historical_data`](iris/iris_utils/historical_data_transformer.py:253)) is currently focused on basic type conversion and date parsing. It may require expansion to handle more diverse raw data formats, perform data cleaning, or address potential inconsistencies from various sources.
*   Error handling during value conversion ([`_convert_value`](iris/iris_utils/historical_data_transformer.py:167)) logs warnings but does not specify how records with conversion errors are treated downstream, potentially leading to data loss without clear indication.
*   Data verification ([`verify_transformed_data`](iris/iris_utils/historical_data_transformer.py:568)) performs essential checks but could be enhanced with more advanced data quality assessments, such as detecting outliers, verifying data frequency, or identifying gaps in time series.
*   The incremental saving mechanism in [`transform_historical_data`](iris/iris_utils/historical_data_transformer.py:253) writes batches to temporary files but lacks a defined process for resuming or reassembling data if the transformation is interrupted.
*   The coverage report's completeness calculation is based on days with data. For high-frequency data, a more granular completeness metric might be necessary.

## Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports:**
    *   [`ingestion.iris_utils.historical_data_retriever`](iris/iris_utils/historical_data_retriever.py): Used for loading the variable catalog and retrieving priority variables.
    *   [`recursive_training.data.data_store`](recursive_training/data/data_store.py): Imports `RecursiveDataStore` for data storage and retrieval.
*   **External Libraries:** `argparse`, `datetime`, `json`, `logging`, `os`, `pathlib`, `typing`, `pandas`, `dateutil.parser`.
*   **Data Interaction:** Reads raw data from JSON files generated by the ingestion process. Stores transformed data in the `RecursiveDataStore`. Reads variable metadata from a shared catalog file. Writes various report and intermediate files to the filesystem.

## Function and Class Example Usages

The module docstring provides clear examples:

```python
from ingestion.iris_utils.historical_data_transformer import (
    transform_and_store_variable,
    transform_and_store_priority_variables,
    verify_transformed_data,
    generate_data_coverage_report
)

# Transform and store data for a specific variable
result = transform_and_store_variable("spx_close")

# Transform and store data for all priority 1 variables
priority_results = transform_and_store_priority_variables(priority=1)

# Verify the consistency of stored data
verification_report = verify_transformed_data("spx_close")

# Generate a coverage report
coverage_report = generate_data_coverage_report()
```

Command-line usage examples are also provided:

```bash
python -m ingestion.iris_utils.historical_data_transformer --variable spx_close
python -m ingestion.iris_utils.historical_data_transformer --priority 1
python -m ingestion.iris_utils.historical_data_transformer --verify spx_close
python -m ingestion.iris_utils.historical_data_transformer --coverage-report
```

## Hardcoding Issues

*   The base directory for historical data (`HISTORICAL_DATA_BASE_DIR`) is hardcoded on [line 76](iris/iris_utils/historical_data_transformer.py:76).
*   The incremental save interval (`save_interval`) is hardcoded on [line 284](iris/iris_utils/historical_data_transformer.py:284).
*   Various internal directory paths for incremental data, transformation results, verifications, and reports are constructed using hardcoded string patterns.

## Coupling Points

*   Strong dependency on the expected structure and location of raw data files produced by the ingestion process ("Phase 2").
*   Coupling with the format and content of the variable catalog.
*   Direct dependency on the [`RecursiveDataStore`](recursive_training/data/data_store.py) class and its API.
*   Dependency on `dateutil.parser` for date string parsing.

## Existing Tests

Based on the project structure provided, there is no dedicated test file (e.g., `tests/iris/iris_utils/test_historical_data_transformer.py`) for this module. This indicates a lack of specific unit or integration tests for the transformation, storage, verification, and reporting logic within this module.

## Module Architecture and Flow

The module is structured procedurally around its main functions. The primary flow involves loading raw data, transforming it record by record, and storing the results in the [`RecursiveDataStore`](recursive_training/data/data_store.py). Auxiliary functions handle data verification and report generation by querying the data store. The [`TransformationResult`](iris/iris_utils/historical_data_transformer.py:88) class serves as a simple data container for operation outcomes. Incremental saving is implemented during transformation. The [`main`](iris/iris_utils/historical_data_transformer.py:768) function provides a command-line interface to trigger these operations.
