# Module Analysis: `learning/plia_stub.py`

## SPARC Alignment

This analysis of [`learning/plia_stub.py`](learning/plia_stub.py:1) is conducted as part of a Sprint 0 codebase review, focusing on granular, file-level detail and adherence to SPARC principles.

## Module Intent/Purpose (SPARC Specification)

The primary role of [`plia_stub.py`](learning/plia_stub.py:1) is to serve as a lightweight diagnostic stub for the Pulse Logic Integrity Audit (PLIA). Its purpose is to provide a basic check of symbolic tension and capital deployment for coherence within the Pulse system's `WorldState`. It is explicitly labeled as a "Stub Mode".

## Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be a functional stub, providing basic diagnostic information. The presence of the `DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` flag and the `set_diagnostics_enabled` function indicates an intention for dynamic control. The "pass (stub mode)" status in the results clearly marks it as incomplete and a placeholder for a more comprehensive future implementation. There are no explicit TODO comments.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

The primary gap is its "stub mode" nature. The current implementation provides a snapshot of symbolic tension and capital deployment but lacks detailed analysis, validation against expected ranges or historical data, and more sophisticated integrity checks that a full PLIA would likely perform. Future steps would involve expanding the diagnostic checks and potentially integrating with a reporting or alerting mechanism.

## Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports:**
    *   [`engine.worldstate.WorldState`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:1): Imports the core `WorldState` class, indicating a direct dependency on the simulation engine's state representation.
    *   [`symbolic_system.symbolic_utils.get_overlay_snapshot`](symbolic_system/symbolic_utils.py:1): Depends on a utility function from the symbolic system to get a snapshot of symbolic overlays.
    *   [`symbolic_system.symbolic_utils.symbolic_tension_score`](symbolic_system/symbolic_utils.py:1): Depends on a utility function from the symbolic system to calculate symbolic tension.
    *   [`capital_engine.capital_layer.total_exposure`](capital_engine/capital_layer.py:1): Depends on a function from the capital engine to get the total capital exposure.
    *   `typing.Dict`, `typing.Any`: Standard Python library imports for type hinting.
    *   [`utils.log_utils.get_logger`](utils/log_utils.py:1): Depends on a utility function for logging.

*   **Interactions:** Interacts with instances of `WorldState` to retrieve necessary data for diagnostics. It also interacts with the logging system.
*   **Input/Output Files:** No direct interaction with files is evident in this module.

## Function and Class Example Usages

*   [`set_diagnostics_enabled(enabled: bool)`](learning/plia_stub.py:21): A simple function to toggle the `DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` global flag.
    ```python
    set_diagnostics_enabled(True)
    ```
*   [`run_plia_stub(state: WorldState) -> Dict[str, Any]`](learning/plia_stub.py:29): The main function that performs the diagnostic checks. It takes a `WorldState` instance and returns a dictionary of results.
    ```python
    from engine.worldstate import WorldState
    state = WorldState() # Assuming WorldState can be initialized like this
    results = run_plia_stub(state)
    print(results)
    ```
*   [`test_plia_stub()`](learning/plia_stub.py:61): A simple test function demonstrating the usage of `set_diagnostics_enabled` and `run_plia_stub`.
    ```python
    test_plia_stub()
    ```

## Hardcoding Issues (SPARC Critical)

*   `DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED = True` (line 19): While this flag can be changed at runtime, its initial hardcoded value might be a minor issue depending on the desired default behavior. It would be better configured externally.
*   `"pass (stub mode)"` (line 50): This is a hardcoded string indicating the stub status. While descriptive for a stub, in a more complete implementation, status messages should likely be more dynamic or come from a centralized status management system.

No hardcoded secrets, API keys, paths, or sensitive data were found.

## Coupling Points

The module is coupled with:
*   `engine.worldstate.WorldState`: Directly uses `WorldState` instances.
*   `symbolic_system.symbolic_utils`: Calls functions from this module.
*   `capital_engine.capital_layer`: Calls functions from this module.
*   `utils.log_utils`: Uses the logging utility.

These couplings are expected given the module's purpose as a diagnostic tool for these specific parts of the system.

## Existing Tests (SPARC Refinement)

The module includes a basic test function, [`test_plia_stub()`](learning/plia_stub.py:61), within the same file. This test checks:
1.  That `run_plia_stub` returns a status starting with "pass" when diagnostics are enabled.
2.  That `run_plia_stub` returns a status of "disabled" when diagnostics are disabled.

**Assessment:**
*   **State:** The test is present and seems functional for the current stub implementation.
*   **Coverage:** Coverage is minimal, only testing the enabled/disabled status and a basic "pass" condition. It does not test the actual values of `symbolic_tension` or `capital_deployed`, nor does it test edge cases or potential error conditions.
*   **Nature:** It's a simple inline test function, not part of a larger test suite (e.g., using `pytest`).
*   **Gaps/Problematic Tests:** The main gap is the lack of comprehensive testing for the actual diagnostic logic and the values returned. A more robust test suite using a framework like `pytest` would be necessary for a non-stub implementation.

## Module Architecture and Flow (SPARC Architecture)

The module architecture is simple:
1.  A global flag `DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` controls the execution.
2.  A function `set_diagnostics_enabled` allows dynamic toggling of the flag.
3.  The main function `run_plia_stub` checks the flag, retrieves data from `WorldState`, `symbolic_utils`, and `capital_layer`, calculates a symbolic tension score, and returns a dictionary of results.
4.  Logging is used to output the diagnostic results.
5.  A simple inline test function demonstrates basic functionality.

The data flow is: `WorldState` -> `run_plia_stub` -> `symbolic_utils`, `capital_layer` -> `run_plia_stub` -> results dictionary and logging.

## Naming Conventions (SPARC Maintainability)

Naming conventions generally follow Python standards (PEP 8). Variable and function names are descriptive (`DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED`, `set_diagnostics_enabled`, `run_plia_stub`, `symbolic_tension`, `capital_deployed`). The use of `PLIA` as an acronym is explained in the docstring.

## SPARC Compliance Summary

*   **Specification:** The module's purpose as a diagnostic stub is clearly defined.
*   **Architecture:** The module has a simple, clear structure appropriate for a stub. Its dependencies are well-defined.
*   **Refinement (Testability):** Existing tests are minimal and only cover basic functionality. Significant test gaps exist for a non-stub implementation.
*   **Refinement (Security):** No critical hardcoded secrets or sensitive data were found. Minor hardcoding of a default flag value and a status string were noted.
*   **Refinement (Maintainability):** Naming conventions are generally good. Code clarity is high due to the module's simplicity. Docstrings are present but could be more detailed for the main function's return value.
*   **No Hardcoding:** Mostly compliant, with minor exceptions noted above.
