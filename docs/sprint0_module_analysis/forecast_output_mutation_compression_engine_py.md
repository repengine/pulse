# Analysis Report: `forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py) module is to process a "forecast episode chain," which represents a series of mutated versions of a forecast. It aims to collapse this chain into a canonical, summarized form. This involves selecting the "best" forecast from the chain, summarizing symbolic drift and arc transitions, and identifying potential instabilities in the forecast's evolution. The module also provides utilities for exporting these compressed forecasts and visualizing their symbolic trajectory.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be largely complete and operational for its defined scope.
- It has functions for core logic: selecting the best forecast, summarizing drift, tagging instability, and compressing the chain.
- It includes utility functions for exporting the compressed data and plotting trajectories.
- A function to summarize a batch of mutation logs is also present.
- There are no obvious `TODO` comments or major placeholders within the implemented functions. The comment `# Add this to mutation_compression_engine.py` on [line 150](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:150) suggests that the [`summarize_mutation_log()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:152) function might have been added or integrated at a different time than the initial set of functions, but it is fully implemented.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Extensibility:** While functional, the criteria for "best" forecast selection in [`select_best_forecast()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:21) are fixed. Future enhancements might involve making these criteria configurable or more sophisticated.
- **Error Handling in Plotting:** The [`plot_symbolic_trajectory()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:116) function imports `matplotlib.pyplot` locally. While common, more robust error handling for cases where `matplotlib` might not be installed or configured (e.g., in a headless environment) could be considered if this module is used in diverse contexts.
- **Detailed Instability Metrics:** The [`tag_symbolic_instability()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:54) function flags instability based on reversals. More granular metrics or different types of instability (e.g., high oscillation frequency, prolonged periods without convergence) could be future additions.
- **Integration with a Broader System:** The module seems designed to be part of a larger forecasting and analysis pipeline. The "follow-up modules/features" would likely be those that consume the output of this compression engine, such as reporting tools, model retraining triggers based on instability, or long-term storage and querying systems for compressed forecasts.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Project Module Imports:
- [`analytics.forecast_episode_tracer.summarize_lineage_drift`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:17)
- [`symbolic_system.symbolic_flip_classifier.extract_transitions`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py:18)

### External Library Dependencies:
- `json` (standard library): Used for loading/dumping forecast data ([line 15](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:15), [line 110](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:110), [line 172](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:172)).
- `typing` (standard library): Used for type hints (`List`, `Dict`, `Optional`) ([line 16](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:16)).
- `matplotlib.pyplot` (external library): Used for plotting in [`plot_symbolic_trajectory()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:116) ([line 128](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:128)). This is a conditional import within the function.

### Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data:
- **Input Data Format:** The module expects input "forecast chains" and "forecast batches" as lists of dictionaries. These dictionaries are expected to have specific keys like `"license_status"`, `"alignment_score"`, `"confidence"`, `"arc_label"`, `"trace_id"`, `"symbolic_tag"`, and `"lineage"`. This implies that other modules (likely in `forecast_engine` or `memory`) are responsible for generating data in this format.
- **Output Data Format:** The compressed forecast is also a dictionary, and the [`export_compressed_episode()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:100) function saves it as a JSONL string. The [`summarize_mutation_log()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:152) function can output a summary in Markdown or JSON.

### Input/Output Files:
- **Input:** Implicitly, the forecast chain data might originate from files or a database, loaded by upstream modules.
- **Output:**
    - Compressed forecasts can be exported to `.jsonl` files via [`export_compressed_episode()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:100).
    - Plots can be saved as image files (e.g., `.png`) via [`plot_symbolic_trajectory()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:116).
    - The [`summarize_mutation_log()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:152) function returns a string, which could be written to a file by the caller.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

- **[`select_best_forecast(chain: List[Dict]) -> Dict`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:21)**:
  ```python
  # chain = [{"license_status": "✅ Approved", "alignment_score": 0.9, "confidence": 0.8, ...}, ...]
  # best_forecast = select_best_forecast(chain)
  # print(best_forecast)
  ```
  This function takes a list of forecast dictionaries and returns the one considered "best" based on approval status, alignment, and confidence.

- **[`compress_episode_chain(chain: List[Dict]) -> Dict`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:74)**:
  ```python
  # forecast_chain_data = [...] # List of forecast dictionaries representing a lineage
  # compressed_data = compress_episode_chain(forecast_chain_data)
  # # compressed_data will contain the best forecast annotated with summary statistics
  # # from the entire chain.
  ```
  This is the core function that takes a full forecast lineage and produces a single, annotated dictionary representing the compressed outcome.

- **[`export_compressed_episode(forecast: Dict, path: str)`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:100)**:
  ```python
  # compressed_forecast = {"trace_id": "final_abc", ...}
  # export_compressed_episode(compressed_forecast, "output/compressed_forecast_abc.jsonl")
  ```
  Saves a compressed forecast dictionary to a specified file path.

- **[`plot_symbolic_trajectory(chain: List[Dict], title: str, export_path: Optional[str])`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:116)**:
  ```python
  # forecast_chain_data = [...]
  # plot_symbolic_trajectory(forecast_chain_data,
  #                          title="Trajectory for Forecast XYZ",
  #                          export_path="output/trajectory_xyz.png")
  ```
  Generates and saves (or displays) a plot showing how "arc_label" and "symbolic_tag" evolve across the forecast versions in a chain.

- **[`summarize_mutation_log(forecast_batch: List[Dict], fmt: str = "markdown") -> str`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:152)**:
  ```python
  # batch_of_forecasts = [
  #   {"lineage": [{"trace_id": "a1"}, {"trace_id": "a2"}]},
  #   {"lineage": [{"trace_id": "b1"}, {"trace_id": "b2"}]}
  # ]
  # markdown_summary = summarize_mutation_log(batch_of_forecasts)
  # print(markdown_summary)
  # json_summary = summarize_mutation_log(batch_of_forecasts, fmt="json")
  # print(json_summary)
  ```
  Processes a list of forecast episodes (each having a "lineage") and returns a summary string in either Markdown or JSON format.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

- **Default Strings:**
    - `"unknown"` is used as a default for `fc.get("arc_label", "unknown")` ([line 49](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:49)), `fc.get("trace_id", "unknown")` ([line 88](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:88)), `fc.get("symbolic_tag", "unknown")` ([line 132](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:132)), and `fc.get("trace_id", "unknown")` ([line 178](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:178)). While practical for missing keys, making these configurable or constants could be an improvement.
    - `"✅ Approved"` is used directly in [`select_best_forecast()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:21) ([line 31](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:31)). This string is critical for logic; if the approval status representation changes elsewhere, this function would break.
    - `"N/A"` is used as a default for missing scores/metrics in [`summarize_mutation_log()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:152) ([lines 179-181](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:179-181)).
- **Plotting Colors:**
    - `"royalblue"` and `"firebrick"` are hardcoded in [`plot_symbolic_trajectory()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:116) ([lines 135-136](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:135-136)).
- **Output Format Strings:**
    - `"markdown"` and `"json"` are used as format specifiers in [`summarize_mutation_log()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:152) ([line 158](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:158), [line 171](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:171)). Using an Enum or constants could be more robust.
- **Default Plot Title:**
    - `"Symbolic Trajectory"` is the default title in [`plot_symbolic_trajectory()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:116) ([line 118](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:118)).
- **Figure Size:**
    - `figsize=(10, 4)` is hardcoded in [`plot_symbolic_trajectory()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:116) ([line 134](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:134)).

## 7. Coupling Points

- **`analytics.forecast_episode_tracer`**: Tightly coupled for the `summarize_lineage_drift` function. Changes in the output structure of this function would directly impact [`compress_episode_chain()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:74).
- **`symbolic_system.symbolic_flip_classifier`**: Tightly coupled for the `extract_transitions` function. Changes in its output would affect [`tag_symbolic_instability()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:54).
- **Data Structure of Forecasts:** The entire module relies heavily on the specific dictionary structure of individual forecasts and forecast chains (keys like `license_status`, `alignment_score`, `confidence`, `arc_label`, `symbolic_tag`, `trace_id`, `lineage`). Any changes to this structure in other parts of the system would require updates here.
- **`matplotlib`**: The plotting functionality is directly tied to `matplotlib`.

## 8. Existing Tests

- Based on the file listing for the [`tests/`](tests/) directory, there does **not** appear to be a specific test file named `test_mutation_compression_engine.py`.
- This indicates a potential gap in unit testing coverage for this particular module.
- While some functionality might be covered by integration tests if this module is called by other tested modules (e.g., if `test_digest_exporter.py` indirectly uses parts of this engine), dedicated unit tests for the logic within `mutation_compression_engine.py` (e.g., [`select_best_forecast()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:21), [`tag_symbolic_instability()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:54), [`compress_episode_chain()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:74)) would be beneficial to ensure its correctness and facilitate refactoring.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module's architecture is functional, consisting of several distinct functions that contribute to the overall compression and analysis process.

**Primary Control Flow (Compression):**
1.  Input: A `chain` (list of forecast dictionaries) is provided to [`compress_episode_chain()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:74).
2.  If the chain is empty, an empty dictionary is returned.
3.  [`summarize_lineage_drift()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py) (from `analytics.forecast_episode_tracer`) is called to get drift metrics.
4.  [`select_best_forecast()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:21) is called to pick the top candidate from the chain based on license, alignment, and confidence.
5.  [`summarize_chain_arcs()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:40) calculates the frequency of arc labels.
6.  The `best` forecast dictionary is annotated with information from the chain: `mutation_compressed_from` (list of trace IDs), `arc_frequency_map`, stability scores, flip counts, and total versions from the drift summary.
7.  [`tag_symbolic_instability()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:54) is called:
    *   It uses [`extract_transitions()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py) (from `symbolic_system.symbolic_flip_classifier`) to get state transitions.
    *   It checks for reversals (A->B and B->A) and tags the `best` forecast with `unstable_symbolic_path` and `symbolic_loops_detected` if found.
8.  The annotated `best` forecast dictionary is returned.

**Other Flows:**
-   [`export_compressed_episode()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:100): Takes a forecast dictionary and writes it to a JSONL file.
-   [`plot_symbolic_trajectory()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:116): Takes a chain, extracts arc labels and symbolic tags, and uses `matplotlib` to plot their evolution.
-   [`summarize_mutation_log()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:152): Iterates through a batch of forecasts, calls [`compress_episode_chain()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:74) on each forecast's lineage, and then formats the collected compressed forecasts into a Markdown or JSON string.

## 10. Naming Conventions

- **Functions:** Generally follow PEP 8 (snake_case, descriptive): [`select_best_forecast()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:21), [`compress_episode_chain()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:74), [`tag_symbolic_instability()`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:54).
- **Variables:** Mostly snake_case: `sorted_chain`, `arc_freq`, `flip_counts`.
    - `fc` is used as a shorthand for "forecast" in loops, which is common and understandable in context.
    - `a`, `b` are used for transitions, which is typical for pairs.
- **Classes:** No classes are defined in this module.
- **Module Name:** [`mutation_compression_engine.py`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py) is descriptive.
- **Docstrings:** Present for all functions, explaining their purpose, arguments, and returns (where applicable). The module docstring also clearly states its purpose.
- **Consistency:** Naming is largely consistent.
- **Potential AI Assumption Errors/Deviations:**
    - The author is listed as "Pulse AI Engine" with "Version: v1.0.0" in the module docstring. This is likely a placeholder or an indication of AI-assisted generation.
    - The comment on [line 150](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py:150) (`# Add this to mutation_compression_engine.py`) suggests a manual or semi-automated integration step, possibly by an AI or a developer following AI instructions.
    - No significant deviations from standard Python naming conventions (PEP 8) are apparent that would strongly indicate AI errors in naming itself. The conventions are followed reasonably well.
