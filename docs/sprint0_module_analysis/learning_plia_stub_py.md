# PLIA Stub Module Analysis (`learning/plia_stub.py`)

## Module Intent/Purpose
The primary role of the `plia_stub.py` module is to perform a **Pulse Logic Integrity Audit (PLIA)** in a "stub" or simplified mode. It's designed as a lightweight diagnostic tool to check for coherence between the symbolic tension within the system's `WorldState` and the total deployed capital. It provides a quick snapshot of these key metrics.

## Operational Status/Completeness
The module appears to be **largely complete for its stated "stub" purpose**.
*   It has a clear function [`run_plia_stub()`](learning/plia_stub.py:29) that performs the audit.
*   It includes a mechanism to dynamically enable/disable diagnostics via [`set_diagnostics_enabled()`](learning/plia_stub.py:21) and the `DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` global variable ([`learning/plia_stub.py:19`](learning/plia_stub.py:19)).
*   It logs its findings.
*   The "stub mode" is explicitly mentioned in the output status ([`learning/plia_stub.py:50`](learning/plia_stub.py:50)), implying this is a basic version and a more comprehensive PLIA might exist or be planned.
*   There are no obvious TODOs or major placeholders within the existing code for its stub functionality.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps
*   **"Stub Mode" Implication:** The most significant sign that the module was intended to be more extensive is the explicit "stub mode" designation. This strongly suggests a more comprehensive PLIA implementation is envisioned, which would likely involve:
    *   More detailed checks beyond just symbolic tension and total capital.
    *   Potentially different levels of audit (e.g., deep audit vs. quick check).
    *   More sophisticated analysis of the `symbolic_state`.
    *   Integration with a more formal alerting or reporting mechanism.
*   **Logical Next Steps:**
    *   Developing the full PLIA functionality.
    *   Defining what constitutes "pass" or "fail" beyond the stub mode's simple "pass (stub mode)".
    *   Integrating this audit into a larger system health check or monitoring framework.
*   **Deviation/Stopped Short:** The module is well-defined for a stub. There's no clear indication of started-then-abandoned paths *within this specific file*, but its existence as a "stub" is the primary indicator of a larger planned feature.

## Connections & Dependencies
*   **Direct Imports from other project modules:**
    *   `from engine.worldstate import WorldState` ([`learning/plia_stub.py:10`](learning/plia_stub.py:10), [`learning/plia_stub.py:65`](learning/plia_stub.py:65)): Depends on the `WorldState` class to get the current state of the simulation.
    *   `from symbolic_system.symbolic_utils import get_overlay_snapshot, symbolic_tension_score` ([`learning/plia_stub.py:11`](learning/plia_stub.py:11)): Uses these utilities to extract symbolic information and calculate tension.
    *   `from capital_engine.capital_layer import total_exposure` ([`learning/plia_stub.py:12`](learning/plia_stub.py:12)): Uses this to get the total capital deployed.
    *   `from utils.log_utils import get_logger` ([`learning/plia_stub.py:14`](learning/plia_stub.py:14)): For logging.
*   **External library dependencies:**
    *   `typing` (specifically `Dict`, `Any`): Standard Python library for type hinting.
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:**
    *   Primarily through the `WorldState` object, which acts as a shared data structure passed into [`run_plia_stub()`](learning/plia_stub.py:29).
*   **Input/output files:**
    *   **Input:** None directly, other than the Python source file itself. It operates on in-memory `WorldState` objects.
    *   **Output:** Log messages are generated via the `logger` ([`learning/plia_stub.py:16`](learning/plia_stub.py:16), [`learning/plia_stub.py:40`](learning/plia_stub.py:40), [`learning/plia_stub.py:53-56`](learning/plia_stub.py:53-56), [`learning/plia_stub.py:72`](learning/plia_stub.py:72)). The location and format of these logs would depend on the `log_utils` configuration.

## Function and Class Example Usages
*   **`set_diagnostics_enabled(enabled: bool)` ([`learning/plia_stub.py:21`](learning/plia_stub.py:21))**:
    ```python
    # To enable PLIA diagnostics
    set_diagnostics_enabled(True)

    # To disable PLIA diagnostics
    set_diagnostics_enabled(False)
    ```
*   **`run_plia_stub(state: WorldState) -> Dict[str, Any]` ([`learning/plia_stub.py:29`](learning/plia_stub.py:29))**:
    ```python
    from engine.worldstate import WorldState

    current_world_state = WorldState()
    # ... (populate or update current_world_state) ...

    # Ensure diagnostics are enabled if needed
    set_diagnostics_enabled(True)

    audit_results = run_plia_stub(current_world_state)
    print(f"Symbolic Tension: {audit_results.get('symbolic_tension')}")
    print(f"Capital Deployed: {audit_results.get('capital_deployed')}")
    print(f"Status: {audit_results.get('status')}")
    ```

## Hardcoding Issues
*   **Status String "pass (stub mode)" ([`learning/plia_stub.py:50`](learning/plia_stub.py:50)) and "disabled" ([`learning/plia_stub.py:41`](learning/plia_stub.py:41))**: While descriptive for a stub, in a more mature system, status codes or enums might be preferred for easier programmatic checking and less fragility.
*   **Log message prefixes like "ðŸ§  [PLIA STUB]" ([`learning/plia_stub.py:53`](learning/plia_stub.py:53))**: These are minor but are hardcoded.
*   **Formatting in log messages (e.g., `:.3f`, `:,.2f`) ([`learning/plia_stub.py:54-55`](learning/plia_stub.py:54-55))**: Specific formatting for floating point numbers and currency. This is generally acceptable for logging but is a form of hardcoding.

## Coupling Points
*   **`WorldState` ([`simulation_engine/worldstate.py`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py))**: Tightly coupled. The entire audit revolves around analyzing a `WorldState` instance. Changes to `WorldState`'s structure could impact `get_overlay_snapshot` or `total_exposure` and thus this module.
*   **`symbolic_utils` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_utils.py`](symbolic_system/symbolic_utils.py))**: Specifically `get_overlay_snapshot` and `symbolic_tension_score`. Changes to the logic or return types of these functions would directly affect `plia_stub`.
*   **`capital_layer` ([`capital_engine/capital_layer.py`](capital_engine/capital_layer.py))**: Specifically `total_exposure`. Changes to this function would directly affect `plia_stub`.
*   **`log_utils` ([`utils/log_utils.py`](utils/log_utils.py))**: Dependency for logging. Changes to the logger acquisition or its interface could break logging in this module.

## Existing Tests
*   **Inline Test Function:** The module contains an inline test function `test_plia_stub()` ([`learning/plia_stub.py:61`](learning/plia_stub.py:61)).
*   **Coverage:**
    *   This test covers the basic functionality:
        *   Running the audit when diagnostics are enabled and checking if the status starts with "pass".
        *   Running the audit when diagnostics are disabled and checking if the status is "disabled".
    *   It creates a default `WorldState()` instance.
*   **Nature of Tests:**
    *   It's a simple functional test verifying the enable/disable mechanism and the basic success path.
    *   It uses `assert` statements for validation.
*   **Gaps/Problematic Tests:**
    *   **No dedicated test file:** Tests are inline, which is acceptable for small, self-contained utilities but less ideal for larger projects where tests are typically separated (e.g., in a `tests/` directory). No `tests/learning/test_plia_stub.py` was found.
    *   **Limited `WorldState` Scenarios:** The test uses a default, likely empty, `WorldState()`. It doesn't test with various `WorldState` configurations that might produce different symbolic tension or capital deployment values. This means the actual calculation logic of `symbolic_tension_score` and `total_exposure` (and `get_overlay_snapshot`) isn't being stress-tested by `test_plia_stub` itself, though those functions should have their own dedicated tests.
    *   **No check of actual values:** The test only checks the `status` field of the results, not the `symbolic_tension` or `capital_deployed` values, even with a default `WorldState`.
    *   **No mocking of dependencies:** The test directly calls imported functions. For more isolated unit testing, dependencies like `get_overlay_snapshot`, `symbolic_tension_score`, and `total_exposure` might be mocked to test the logic of `run_plia_stub` in isolation.

## Module Architecture and Flow
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   A global boolean `DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` ([`learning/plia_stub.py:19`](learning/plia_stub.py:19)) is set to `True` by default.
    *   A logger instance is obtained.
2.  **`set_diagnostics_enabled(enabled: bool)` ([`learning/plia_stub.py:21`](learning/plia_stub.py:21))**:
    *   Allows runtime modification of the `DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` flag.
3.  **`run_plia_stub(state: WorldState)` ([`learning/plia_stub.py:29`](learning/plia_stub.py:29))**:
    *   **Input:** A `WorldState` object.
    *   **Control Flow:**
        *   Checks if `DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` is `False`. If so, logs a message and returns `{"status": "disabled"}`.
        *   If enabled:
            *   Calls `get_overlay_snapshot(state)` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_utils.py`](symbolic_system/symbolic_utils.py)) to get the symbolic state.
            *   Calls `symbolic_tension_score(symbolic_state)` ([`symbolic_system/symbolic_utils.py`](symbolic_system/symbolic_utils.py)) to calculate tension.
            *   Calls `total_exposure(state)` ([`capital_engine/capital_layer.py`](capital_engine/capital_layer.py)) to get deployed capital.
            *   Constructs a results dictionary containing tension, capital, the symbolic state snapshot, and a status of "pass (stub mode)".
            *   Logs the key results.
            *   Returns the results dictionary.
4.  **`test_plia_stub()` ([`learning/plia_stub.py:61`](learning/plia_stub.py:61))**:
    *   Sets diagnostics to `True`, runs the audit, asserts status.
    *   Sets diagnostics to `False`, runs the audit, asserts status.
    *   Logs a success message.
5.  **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`learning/plia_stub.py:75`](learning/plia_stub.py:75))**:
    *   Calls `test_plia_stub()` when the script is executed directly.
