# Module Analysis: `symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py`

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Author:** Pulse AI Engine

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:1) module is to analyze symbolic learning profiles and generate proposals for upgrading the symbolic system. This involves:
- Identifying underperforming symbolic arcs and tags.
- Recognizing high-performing symbolic arcs and tags.
- Suggesting actions such as replacing or retraining failing symbols.
- Recommending boosting successful symbolic strategies.
- (Intended) Adjusting overlay defaults or tag heuristics, though direct implementation for this specific adjustment is not apparent in the current proposal logic.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be a functional first version (v1.0.0). It contains core functionalities for:
- Detecting symbol performance using [`detect_underperforming_symbols()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:23) and [`detect_high_performers()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:38).
- Proposing upgrades via [`propose_symbolic_upgrades()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:53).
- Exporting the generated plan to a JSON file using [`export_upgrade_plan()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:83).

An internal test function, [`_test_symbolic_upgrade_planner()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:102), provides basic validation for the proposal logic. No explicit TODOs or major placeholders are visible in the code, suggesting a degree of completeness for the implemented features.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

-   **Sophistication of Suggestions:** The upgrade suggestions in [`propose_symbolic_upgrades()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:77-78) are basic, merely taking the top three underperforming and high-performing symbols. More advanced logic could consider the magnitude of performance, inter-symbol relationships, or a wider range of corrective actions.
-   **Overlay/Heuristic Adjustments:** The module's docstring mentions adjusting "overlay defaults or tag heuristics" (line 9), but the current [`propose_symbolic_upgrades()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:53) function does not explicitly generate suggestions for these types of adjustments.
-   **Plan Execution:** The module only proposes and exports plans. A logical next step would be the development of a component or module that consumes these plans and executes the recommended upgrades.
-   **Configurable Thresholds:** Performance detection thresholds (e.g., `threshold = 0.4`, `min_total = 3`) are hardcoded as default function parameters. These could be made configurable, perhaps loaded from an external configuration file for greater flexibility.
-   **Error Handling:** Error handling in [`export_upgrade_plan()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:91-99) is generic. More specific error types or recovery mechanisms could enhance robustness.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

-   **Internal Project Imports:** None directly visible in this file. It operates on data structures (the `profile` dictionary) passed as arguments.
-   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html): For reading and writing JSON data (used in [`export_upgrade_plan()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:83)).
    *   [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html): For application-level logging.
    *   [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html): For type hints (`Dict`, `List`).
-   **Shared Data Interactions:**
    *   **Input:** Consumes a `profile` dictionary (Dict) which is expected to contain keys like `"arc_performance"`, `"tag_performance"`, and `"last_updated"`. This profile is presumably generated by a symbolic learning or performance tracking module within the broader system (e.g., potentially related to [`symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_learning_loop.py`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_learning_loop.py)).
    *   **Output:** Produces a JSON file (default: [`plans/symbolic_upgrade_plan.json`](plans/symbolic_upgrade_plan.json)) containing the upgrade plan. This file is likely intended for consumption by another system component responsible for implementing or reviewing the proposed upgrades.
-   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** The learning `profile` data structure.
    *   **Output:**
        *   JSON upgrade plan file (e.g., [`plans/symbolic_upgrade_plan.json`](plans/symbolic_upgrade_plan.json)).
        *   Log messages via the `logging` module.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

(No classes are defined in this module.)

-   **`detect_underperforming_symbols(performance: Dict[str, Dict], threshold: float = 0.4, min_total: int = 3) -> List[str]`**
    *   Identifies symbols whose success rate is below `threshold` and have at least `min_total` occurrences.
    ```python
    perf_data = {"arc_A": {"rate": 0.3, "total": 10}, "arc_B": {"rate": 0.9, "total": 2}, "arc_C": {"rate": 0.2, "total": 3}}
    underperforming = detect_underperforming_symbols(perf_data)
    # underperforming would be ["arc_A", "arc_C"]
    ```

-   **`detect_high_performers(performance: Dict[str, Dict], threshold: float = 0.85, min_total: int = 3) -> List[str]`**
    *   Identifies symbols whose success rate is above `threshold` and have at least `min_total` occurrences.
    ```python
    perf_data = {"tag_X": {"rate": 0.9, "total": 10}, "tag_Y": {"rate": 0.7, "total": 5}, "tag_Z": {"rate": 0.88, "total": 3}}
    high_performers = detect_high_performers(perf_data)
    # high_performers would be ["tag_X", "tag_Z"]
    ```

-   **`propose_symbolic_upgrades(profile: Dict) -> Dict`**
    *   Generates an upgrade plan based on the performance data in the `profile`.
    ```python
    learning_profile = {
        "arc_performance": {"GoodArc": {"rate": 0.9, "total": 10}, "BadArc": {"rate": 0.2, "total": 5}},
        "tag_performance": {"StrongTag": {"rate": 0.95, "total": 8}, "WeakTag": {"rate": 0.3, "total": 6}},
        "last_updated": "2024-05-18T10:00:00Z"
    }
    upgrade_plan = propose_symbolic_upgrades(learning_profile)
    # upgrade_plan will contain 'underperforming_arcs': ['BadArc'], 'strong_tags': ['StrongTag'], etc.
    ```

-   **`export_upgrade_plan(plan: Dict, path: str = "plans/symbolic_upgrade_plan.json")`**
    *   Saves the generated `plan` dictionary to a JSON file at the specified `path`.
    ```python
    # Assuming 'upgrade_plan' from the previous example
    export_upgrade_plan(upgrade_plan, "output/my_upgrade_plan.json")
    # This will save the plan to 'output/my_upgrade_plan.json'
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **Default Thresholds:**
    *   In [`detect_underperforming_symbols()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:23): `threshold: float = 0.4`, `min_total: int = 3`.
    *   In [`detect_high_performers()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:38): `threshold: float = 0.85`, `min_total: int = 3`.
-   **Suggestion Limits:** The number of items included in `"boost"` and `"replace_or_retrain"` suggestions within [`propose_symbolic_upgrades()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:77-78) is hardcoded to the top 3 (e.g., `tag_strengths[:3]`).
-   **Default File Path:** In [`export_upgrade_plan()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:83): `path: str = "plans/symbolic_upgrade_plan.json"`.
-   **Logger Name:** The logger is named `"symbolic_upgrade_planner"` (line 19).
-   **Log Messages:** Specific string literals are used for logging (e.g., "❌ Invalid plan: not a dict", "📤 Upgrade plan saved to {path}").

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **Input Profile Structure:** The module is tightly coupled to the expected structure of the input `profile` dictionary. It specifically relies on keys like `"arc_performance"`, `"tag_performance"`, and `"last_updated"`, and expects nested dictionaries with `"rate"` and `"total"` keys. Changes to this data structure in the producer module would break this planner.
-   **Output Plan Structure:** Consumers of the output JSON plan are coupled to its specific structure (e.g., keys like `"underperforming_arcs"`, `"strong_tags"`, `"suggestions"`).
-   **Inter-module Data Flow:** Relies on an upstream process to generate the learning `profile` and a downstream process to interpret and act upon the exported `plan`.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   A basic, inline test function [`_test_symbolic_upgrade_planner()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:102) is present.
-   This test is executed when the script is run directly (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
-   It uses a `dummy_profile` and `assert` statements to perform a sanity check on the output of [`propose_symbolic_upgrades()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:53).
-   **Gaps:**
    *   Does not test the [`export_upgrade_plan()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:83) function, including file I/O success or failure scenarios.
    *   Does not cover edge cases for [`detect_underperforming_symbols()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:23) and [`detect_high_performers()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:38) (e.g., empty performance data, symbols not meeting `min_total`, all symbols performing identically).
    *   No separate test file (e.g., in a `tests/` directory using a framework like `pytest`) is apparent from the provided context, indicating testing is currently limited to this inline check.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module follows a procedural approach:
1.  **Input:** Takes a `profile` dictionary (presumably from a learning system) detailing the performance of symbolic arcs and tags.
2.  **Analysis:**
    *   [`detect_underperforming_symbols()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:23): Filters for symbols performing below a defined threshold.
    *   [`detect_high_performers()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:38): Filters for symbols performing above a defined threshold.
3.  **Proposal Generation:**
    *   [`propose_symbolic_upgrades()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:53): Consolidates the findings into a structured dictionary. This dictionary lists underperforming and strong symbols and provides simple suggestions to "boost" strong elements or "replace_or_retrain" weak ones.
4.  **Export (Optional):**
    *   [`export_upgrade_plan()`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:83): Serializes the proposal dictionary into a JSON file.
5.  **Logging:** Throughout the process, informational messages and errors are logged using the standard `logging` module.

The overall data flow is linear: profile data -> analysis -> proposal dictionary -> JSON file.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   **Functions:** Adhere to PEP 8 (snake_case, e.g., [`detect_underperforming_symbols`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:23), [`propose_symbolic_upgrades`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:53)). The internal test function [`_test_symbolic_upgrade_planner`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py:102) uses a conventional leading underscore.
-   **Variables:** Mostly snake_case (e.g., `arc_perf`, `min_total`, `dummy_profile`). Single-letter variables (`k`, `v`, `f`, `e`) are used appropriately in limited scopes (iterations, file handling, exceptions).
-   **Parameters:** Descriptive (e.g., `performance`, `threshold`, `profile`).
-   **Strings:** Log messages are clear. Symbolic names within the test data (e.g., "Hope Surge", "Collapse Risk") use title case, which might reflect their representation elsewhere.
-   **Module Name:** [`symbolic_upgrade_planner.py`](symbolic_system/symbolic_upgrade_planner.py) is descriptive of its function.
-   **Logger Name:** `"symbolic_upgrade_planner"` (line 19) is consistent and descriptive.

The naming conventions are generally clear, consistent with Python best practices (PEP 8), and do not show obvious signs of AI misinterpretation or deviation from typical project standards.
