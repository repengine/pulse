# Module Analysis: `iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py`

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-16

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py) module is to integrate high-frequency technical indicators into the Iris variable ingestion pipeline. It achieves this by fetching indicator data for a predefined list of stock symbols, processing this data, and then formatting it into standardized signal dictionaries that can be consumed by other parts of the Iris system.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears largely functional for its core purpose of fetching and formatting high-frequency indicators.

*   **Complete:**
    *   Fetches symbols from [`AlphaVantagePlugin`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/alpha_vantage_plugin.py).
    *   Utilizes [`HighFrequencyDataAccess`](../../../../data/high_frequency_data_access.py) and [`HighFrequencyIndicators`](../../../../iris/high_frequency_indicators.py) to retrieve indicator values.
    *   Transforms results into the required signal dictionary format.
    *   Basic error logging is implemented.
*   **Incomplete/Placeholders:**
    *   **Timestamp:** A critical placeholder exists for the signal timestamp (see [`fetch_signals()`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:64-66)). It currently uses `dt.datetime.now(dt.timezone.utc)`, but the comment correctly notes: "ideally, this would be the timestamp of the latest data point used in the calculation."
    *   **Error Handling Detail:** The error handling in [`fetch_signals()`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:74-78) currently logs the error and returns an empty list. The comment "Depending on requirements, you might want to return an empty list or include an error signal here" suggests this might need further refinement based on system-wide error handling strategies.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Accurate Timestamps:** The most significant gap is the placeholder for signal timestamps. This needs to be addressed to ensure data integrity and correct temporal analysis by downstream systems. The timestamp should reflect the actual time of the data point(s) used to calculate the indicator.
*   **Enhanced Error Signaling:** Instead of returning an empty list on error, the plugin could be enhanced to return specific error signals or raise exceptions that can be more informatively handled by the `IrisPluginManager` or other calling systems.
*   **Symbol Source Configuration:** The plugin is tightly coupled to [`AlphaVantagePlugin.STOCK_SYMBOLS`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/alpha_vantage_plugin.py:20) for its list of symbols. Future enhancements could include:
    *   A dedicated configuration for symbols within this plugin.
    *   An abstract interface for obtaining symbols, allowing different sources.
*   **Indicator Configuration:** The selection and calculation parameters for high-frequency indicators are managed by [`HighFrequencyIndicators`](../../../../iris/high_frequency_indicators.py). This plugin currently has no mechanism to influence which indicators are fetched or their parameters.
*   **Robust Variable Name Parsing:** The parsing of `var_name` in [`fetch_signals()`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:50-57) (e.g., `hf_rsi_AAPL`) assumes a fixed format (`hf_<indicator>_<symbol>`). This could be made more robust or configurable to handle variations or more complex naming schemes. Logging a warning and setting "unknown" for type/symbol might obscure underlying data issues.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Project Module Imports:**
    *   [`data.high_frequency_data_access.HighFrequencyDataAccess`](../../../../data/high_frequency_data_access.py)
    *   [`data.high_frequency_data_store.HighFrequencyDataStore`](../../../../data/high_frequency_data_store.py)
    *   [`ingestion.high_frequency_indicators.HighFrequencyIndicators`](../../../../iris/high_frequency_indicators.py)
    *   [`core.variable_registry.VARIABLE_REGISTRY`](../../../../core/variable_registry.py) (Imported, but not directly used in the `fetch_signals` method shown. Potentially used by the base class or for future extensions.)
    *   [`ingestion.iris_plugins.IrisPluginManager`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins.py) (Base class)
    *   [`ingestion.iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.alpha_vantage_plugin.AlphaVantagePlugin`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/alpha_vantage_plugin.py) (Specifically for `STOCK_SYMBOLS`)
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   `datetime` (as `dt`)
    *   `logging`
    *   `typing` (Dict, List, Any)
*   **Shared Data Interactions:**
    *   Reads data implicitly via [`HighFrequencyDataAccess`](../../../../data/high_frequency_data_access.py) which uses [`HighFrequencyDataStore`](../../../../data/high_frequency_data_store.py).
    *   Consumes the `STOCK_SYMBOLS` dictionary from [`AlphaVantagePlugin`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/alpha_vantage_plugin.py).
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** Data is sourced from the `HighFrequencyDataStore` (details of this store are abstracted by `HighFrequencyDataAccess`).
    *   **Output:** The [`fetch_signals()`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:28) method returns a list of signal dictionaries.
    *   **Logs:** Uses the standard Python `logging` module to output logs.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

*   **`HighFrequencyIndicatorPlugin` Class:**
    *   This class inherits from [`IrisPluginManager`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins.py).
    *   It's intended to be registered with an instance of `IrisPluginManager`.
    *   The core logic resides in its [`fetch_signals()`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:28) method.
    *   Example (commented out in the module):
        ```python
        # from ingestion.iris_plugins import IrisPluginManager
        # from ingestion.iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.high_frequency_indicator_plugin import HighFrequencyIndicatorPlugin
        # manager = IrisPluginManager()
        # plugin_instance = HighFrequencyIndicatorPlugin()
        # manager.register_plugin(plugin_instance.fetch_signals) # Or however plugins are registered
        # signals = plugin_instance.fetch_signals()
        # for signal in signals:
        #     print(signal)
        ```

*   **[`fetch_signals()`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:28) Method:**
    *   This method orchestrates the fetching and processing of indicators.
    *   It instantiates data access and indicator calculation classes.
    *   It retrieves symbols from [`AlphaVantagePlugin.STOCK_SYMBOLS`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/alpha_vantage_plugin.py).
    *   It calls [`indicators.get_latest_high_frequency_indicators(symbols)`](../../../../iris/high_frequency_indicators.py) to get raw indicator data.
    *   It then loops through these results, parses the variable name (e.g., `hf_rsi_AAPL`) to extract metadata like `indicator_type` ('rsi') and `symbol` ('AAPL').
    *   Finally, it constructs and returns a list of signal dictionaries. Each dictionary includes:
        *   `name`: The original variable name (e.g., "hf_rsi_AAPL").
        *   `value`: The calculated indicator value.
        *   `source`: Hardcoded to "high_frequency_indicators".
        *   `timestamp`: Currently a placeholder (current UTC time); needs to be the actual data timestamp.
        *   `metadata`: A dictionary containing `symbol` and `indicator_type`.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Plugin Identification:**
    *   [`plugin_name = "high_frequency_indicator_plugin"`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:25): Standard for plugin systems.
    *   [`enabled = True`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:26): Default status, likely intended to be configurable externally.
*   **Signal Source:**
    *   [`source: "high_frequency_indicators"`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:63) in the output signal dictionary is hardcoded. This might be acceptable if it's a fixed identifier for this data type.
*   **Variable Name Parsing Logic:**
    *   The assumption that variable names start with `"hf_"` and are underscore-separated (e.g., `hf_<indicator>_<symbol>`) is embedded in the parsing logic (lines [`50-53`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:50-53)). Changes to this naming convention from the `HighFrequencyIndicators` module would break this parsing.
    *   Defaulting `indicator_type` and `symbol` to `"unknown"` (lines [`55-56`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:55-56)) upon parsing failure can mask issues with upstream data or naming conventions.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **[`AlphaVantagePlugin`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/alpha_vantage_plugin.py):** Tightly coupled for obtaining the `STOCK_SYMBOLS` list. Any change in how `AlphaVantagePlugin` stores or provides these symbols, or if it's unavailable, will directly affect this plugin.
*   **Data Layer Abstractions:**
    *   [`HighFrequencyDataStore`](../../../../data/high_frequency_data_store.py)
    *   [`HighFrequencyDataAccess`](../../../../data/high_frequency_data_access.py)
    *   [`HighFrequencyIndicators`](../../../../iris/high_frequency_indicators.py)
    The plugin relies heavily on the APIs and behavior of these components. Changes to their interfaces or functionality would require updates here.
*   **[`IrisPluginManager`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins.py):** Dependency on the base class contract and the plugin registration mechanism of the broader Iris system.
*   **Output Signal Structure:** Consumers of the signals generated by this plugin depend on the specific structure and keys of the output dictionaries (e.g., `name`, `value`, `timestamp`, `metadata.symbol`).
*   **Variable Naming Convention:** The successful parsing of indicator type and symbol from the `var_name` (e.g., `hf_rsi_AAPL`) depends on the `HighFrequencyIndicators` module producing names in this expected format.

## 8. Existing Tests

Based on the provided file listing, a specific test file for `high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py` (e.g., `tests/iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/test_high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py`) is not immediately visible. A comprehensive assessment of test coverage would require inspecting the `tests` directory structure. Without this, it's assumed that dedicated tests for this specific plugin might be missing or located elsewhere.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

1.  The `HighFrequencyIndicatorPlugin` class inherits from `IrisPluginManager`, indicating it's a pluggable component within the Iris system.
2.  The primary entry point for its functionality is the [`fetch_signals()`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:28) method.
3.  **Initialization within `fetch_signals()`:**
    *   Instantiates [`HighFrequencyDataStore()`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:36).
    *   Instantiates [`HighFrequencyDataAccess(data_store)`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:37).
    *   Instantiates [`HighFrequencyIndicators(data_access)`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:38).
4.  **Symbol Retrieval:**
    *   Fetches stock symbols from [`AlphaVantagePlugin.STOCK_SYMBOLS`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:41).
5.  **Indicator Calculation:**
    *   Calls [`indicators.get_latest_high_frequency_indicators(symbols)`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:44) to obtain the raw indicator data.
6.  **Signal Transformation:**
    *   Iterates through the `indicator_results` dictionary.
    *   For each `var_name` and `value`:
        *   Parses `var_name` (assumed format: `hf_<indicator>_<symbol>`) to extract `indicator_type` and `symbol`. Logs a warning if parsing fails.
        *   Constructs a signal dictionary containing `name`, `value`, `source` ("high_frequency_indicators"), a placeholder `timestamp`, and `metadata` (with `symbol` and `indicator_type`).
    *   Appends each signal dictionary to the `signals` list.
7.  **Return Value:**
    *   Returns the `signals` list.
8.  **Error Handling:**
    *   A `try-except` block wraps the main logic. If an `Exception` occurs, it's logged, and an empty list is returned.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Classes:** `HighFrequencyIndicatorPlugin`, `HighFrequencyDataStore`, `HighFrequencyDataAccess`, `HighFrequencyIndicators`, `AlphaVantagePlugin` use PascalCase, adhering to PEP 8.
*   **Methods & Functions:** [`fetch_signals()`](../../../../iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/high_frequency_indicator_plugin.py:28) uses snake_case, adhering to PEP 8.
*   **Variables:** `plugin_name`, `enabled`, `signals`, `data_store`, `data_access`, `indicators`, `symbols`, `indicator_results`, `var_name`, `value`, `parts`, `indicator_type`, `symbol`, `logger` all use snake_case, which is PEP 8 compliant.
*   **Constants:** `STOCK_SYMBOLS` (imported) and `VARIABLE_REGISTRY` (imported) are in UPPER_CASE, as per PEP 8.
*   **Internal Naming Scheme:** The module expects and parses variable names with the pattern `hf_<indicator>_<symbol>` (e.g., `hf_rsi_AAPL`). This is a project-specific convention.
*   **Overall Consistency:** Naming conventions appear consistent with PEP 8 and common Python practices. No obvious deviations or AI-induced errors in naming are apparent from the snippet.
