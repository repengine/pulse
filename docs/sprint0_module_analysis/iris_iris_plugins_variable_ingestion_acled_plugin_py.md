# Module Analysis: `iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

This module is intended to be a plugin for the Iris system, specifically designed to ingest geopolitical data from the ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project) API. Its primary role is to fetch conflict event data and format it as signals for use within the Iris ecosystem.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module is currently a **stub** and is **not operational**.
- The `enabled` flag is explicitly set to `False` ([`iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:10`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:10)).
- The core data fetching method, [`fetch_signals()`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:13), contains a `TODO` comment: `# TODO: implement real fetch + formatting` ([`iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:14`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:14)) and currently returns an empty list.
- An [`additional_method()`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:17) is defined but is also a placeholder, containing only a `pass` statement.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Core Functionality:** The primary gap is the lack of implementation for the [`fetch_signals()`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:13) method. This method needs to:
    - Connect to the ACLED API. This will likely require handling an API key, as suggested by the comment: `enabled = False # flip to True and provide API key to activate` ([`iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:10`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:10)).
    - Fetch relevant data based on specified parameters (if any).
    - Transform and format the fetched data into the expected `List[Dict[str, Any]]` structure for signals.
- **Undefined Method:** The purpose and implementation of [`additional_method()`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:17) are completely undefined.
- **Supporting Features:**
    - Error handling for API requests (e.g., network issues, API errors, rate limits).
    - Logging for operational monitoring and debugging.
    - Configuration management for API endpoint, API key, request parameters, and retry logic.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

- **Direct Project Imports:**
    - `from ingestion.iris_plugins import IrisPluginManager` ([`iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:6`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:6)): The [`AcledPlugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:8) class inherits from [`IrisPluginManager`](iris/iris_plugins.py:0), integrating it into the Iris plugin framework.
- **External Library Dependencies:**
    - `typing` (Python standard library): Used for type hinting (`List`, `Dict`, `Any`).
    - **Implicit Future Dependencies:** An HTTP client library (e.g., `requests`, `httpx`, or `aiohttp`) will be required to interact with the ACLED API once implemented.
- **Interaction with Other Modules (Shared Data):**
    - As an Iris plugin, it's designed to provide data (signals) to the broader Iris system. This data would likely be consumed by other modules responsible for processing, analyzing, storing, or acting upon these geopolitical signals.
- **Input/Output Files:**
    - **Input:** No direct file input is evident in the stub. It might read configuration files for API keys or other settings once fully developed.
    - **Output:** No direct file output is evident. It could produce log files.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

- **Class: `AcledPlugin`** ([`iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:8`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:8))
    - This class would be discovered, instantiated, and managed by the Iris plugin framework. The framework would then interact with its methods.
    ```python
    # Conceptual usage by an Iris plugin manager
    # from ingestion.iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.acled_plugin import AcledPlugin
    #
    # acled_instance = AcledPlugin()
    #
    # if acled_instance.enabled:
    #     try:
    #         geopolitical_signals = acled_instance.fetch_signals()
    #         # Further processing of geopolitical_signals
    #         for signal in geopolitical_signals:
    #             print(signal)
    #     except Exception as e:
    #         print(f"Error fetching ACLED signals: {e}")
    #
    # # Potentially call other methods if defined and relevant
    # # acled_instance.additional_method()
    ```

- **Method: `fetch_signals(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`** ([`iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:13`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:13))
    - **Intended Use:** To be called by the Iris system to retrieve the latest geopolitical signals from the ACLED API.
    - **Current State:** Returns an empty list: `return []`.

- **Method: `additional_method(self) -> None`** ([`iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:17`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:17))
    - **Intended Use:** The purpose of this method is not defined in the stub.
    - **Current State:** Contains only a `pass` statement.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

- **`plugin_name = "acled_plugin"`** ([`iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:9`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:9)): The plugin's identifier is hardcoded. This is generally acceptable and often necessary for plugin registration systems.
- **`enabled = False`** ([`iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:10`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:10)): The default disabled state is hardcoded. Activation requires a manual code change to `True` and, as per the comment, provision of an API key. This should ideally be managed via a configuration mechanism rather than direct code modification for enabling/disabling.
- **`concurrency = 2`** ([`iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:11`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:11)): The concurrency level for the plugin is hardcoded to `2`. This value might be better suited for external configuration to allow tuning based on system resources or API rate limits.

## 7. Coupling Points

- **Inheritance:** Tightly coupled to the [`IrisPluginManager`](iris/iris_plugins.py:0) class from the [`ingestion.iris_plugins`](iris/iris_plugins.py) module through class inheritance. Changes in the base class could directly impact this plugin.
- **API Dependency (Future):** Once implemented, it will be tightly coupled to the ACLED API's contract (endpoint, request/response format, authentication).
- **Data Contract:** The data structure `List[Dict[str, Any]]` returned by [`fetch_signals()`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:13) creates a data contract. Downstream consumers within the Iris system will depend on this structure.

## 8. Existing Tests

- **Status:** No dedicated test file (e.g., `test_acled_plugin.py`) was found in the expected test directories (`tests/iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/` or `tests/plugins/`).
- **Coverage:** Given the module is a stub, test coverage is effectively none.
- **Gaps:** Comprehensive tests will be required once the module is implemented, covering:
    - API interaction mocking and testing (success and failure cases).
    - Data transformation and formatting logic.
    - Error handling.
    - Configuration loading (if implemented).

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

- **Structure:** The module defines a single class, [`AcledPlugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:8), which inherits from [`IrisPluginManager`](iris/iris_plugins.py:0).
- **Intended Control Flow:**
    1. The Iris plugin system discovers and loads the [`AcledPlugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:8).
    2. An instance of [`AcledPlugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:8) is created.
    3. The system checks the `enabled` attribute.
    4. If `enabled` is `True`, the Iris system (or a scheduler within it) calls the [`fetch_signals()`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:13) method periodically or as triggered.
    5. The (future) implemented [`fetch_signals()`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:13) method would:
        a.  Authenticate with the ACLED API.
        b.  Make requests to the ACLED API.
        c.  Receive and parse the API response.
        d.  Transform the data into the required signal format.
        e.  Return the list of signals.
    6. The [`additional_method()`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:17) could be called if its purpose were defined and integrated into a workflow.
- **Data Flow:**
    - External data from ACLED API -> [`fetch_signals()`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:13) method -> Formatted signals (List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Iris system.

## 10. Naming Conventions

- **Class Names:** [`AcledPlugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:8) uses PascalCase, adhering to PEP 8.
- **Method Names:** [`fetch_signals`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:13), [`additional_method`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion/acled_plugin.py:17) use snake_case, adhering to PEP 8.
- **Variable Names:** `plugin_name`, `enabled`, `concurrency` use snake_case, adhering to PEP 8.
- **Type Hinting:** Uses standard types from the `typing` module. The use of `Any` in `List[Dict[str, Any]]` is broad but acceptable for a stub where the precise signal structure is yet to be finalized.
- **Consistency:** Naming conventions are consistent within the module and align well with Python community standards (PEP 8).
- **AI Assumption Errors:** No obvious errors stemming from AI assumptions in naming are apparent. The names are descriptive and conventional for a plugin of this nature.
