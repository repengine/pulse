# Module Analysis: `pipeline/rule_engine.py`

## Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`pipeline/rule_engine.py`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:) module is to manage the lifecycle of dynamic rules within the system. This includes generating new rules, evaluating their performance, and pruning ineffective or outdated rules. It is intended to leverage both GPT and symbolic systems for these tasks.

## Operational Status/Completeness

The module is currently a **stub** and is **not operational**. It contains a single class, [`RuleEngine`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:9), with method definitions for [`generate_rules`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:16), [`evaluate_rules`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:23), and [`prune_rules`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:30). All method bodies consist of `pass` statements and `TODO` comments, indicating that the core logic has not yet been implemented.

- `TODO: set up GPT client and symbolic_system interfaces` ([`pipeline/rule_engine.py:14`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:14))
- `TODO: implement rule generation logic using GPT and pulse_symbolic_revision_planner` ([`pipeline/rule_engine.py:20`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:20))
- `TODO: implement batch rule evaluation in engine.rule_mutation_engine` ([`pipeline/rule_engine.py:27`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:27))
- `TODO: implement pruning strategy` ([`pipeline/rule_engine.py:34`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:34))

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Core Logic Implementation:** The most significant gap is the lack of implementation for the core functionalities: rule generation, evaluation, and pruning. The `TODO` comments clearly outline these missing pieces.
*   **GPT Client Integration:** The module needs to establish a connection and interface with a GPT client, as indicated in the `__init__` method's `TODO`.
*   **Symbolic System Integration:** Integration with the `symbolic_system` (specifically mentioning [`pulse_symbolic_revision_planner`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:)) is planned but not implemented.
*   **Simulation Engine Interaction:** Rule evaluation is intended to interact with [`engine.rule_mutation_engine`](simulation_engine/rule_mutation_engine.py:), but this link is not yet established.
*   **Pruning Strategy:** A strategy for how rules will be pruned based on performance metrics needs to be defined and implemented.

Logical next steps involve addressing each of_the `TODO` comments, starting with setting up the necessary client interfaces and then implementing the logic for each method.

## Connections & Dependencies

Based on the `TODO` comments and module purpose:

*   **Direct Imports from other project modules (Anticipated):**
    *   Likely from `symbolic_system` (e.g., [`pulse_symbolic_revision_planner`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:)).
    *   Likely from `simulation_engine` (e.g., [`rule_mutation_engine`](simulation_engine/rule_mutation_engine.py:)).
*   **External Library Dependencies (Anticipated):**
    *   A library for interacting with a GPT model (e.g., `openai`).
    *   The `typing` module is currently imported for `None`, but this might change as type hints become more specific.
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:**
    *   Potentially with a rule storage mechanism (database or file-based) where generated rules are stored and from which they are retrieved for evaluation and pruning.
    *   Interaction with model performance data to inform rule generation.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** Model performance metrics, existing rule sets, symbolic revision plans.
    *   **Output:** New/updated rule sets, logs of rule generation/evaluation/pruning activities.

## Function and Class Example Usages

As the module is a stub, concrete usage examples are not yet possible. However, the intended usage pattern for the [`RuleEngine`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:9) class would likely be:

```python
# Hypothetical usage
# from pipeline.rule_engine import RuleEngine # Assuming RuleEngine is made available

# rule_engine = RuleEngine()

# # Generate new rules
# rule_engine.generate_rules()

# # Evaluate the proposed rules
# rule_engine.evaluate_rules()

# # Prune low-performing rules
# rule_engine.prune_rules()
```

## Hardcoding Issues

Currently, there are no hardcoded variables, symbols, secrets, paths, or magic numbers/strings, as the module is largely unimplemented. This should be monitored as development progresses.

## Coupling Points

Significant coupling points are anticipated with:

*   **GPT Service:** For rule generation.
*   **`symbolic_system`:** Specifically [`pulse_symbolic_revision_planner`](symbolic_system/pulse_symbolic_revision_planner.py:) for rule generation.
*   **`simulation_engine`:** Specifically [`rule_mutation_engine`](simulation_engine/rule_mutation_engine.py:) for rule evaluation.
*   **Data sources/sinks:** For model performance data and rule storage.

## Existing Tests

No specific test file (e.g., `tests/pipeline/test_rule_engine.py` or `tests/test_pipeline_rule_engine.py`) was found in the `tests/` directory. Therefore, it is assumed that **no dedicated tests currently exist** for this module. Given its stub nature, this is expected.

## Module Architecture and Flow

The planned architecture is a class-based [`RuleEngine`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:9) that orchestrates three main processes:
1.  **Generation:** New rules are proposed, likely triggered by analysis of model performance or symbolic revisions. This step involves interacting with GPT and the symbolic planner.
2.  **Evaluation:** Proposed rules are tested for efficacy, likely through simulations and retrodiction via the simulation engine.
3.  **Pruning:** Rules that don't meet performance criteria are removed.

The data flow would involve:
*   Inputting performance data and symbolic plans.
*   Generating rule candidates.
*   Passing these candidates to an evaluation mechanism.
*   Receiving evaluation metrics.
*   Applying pruning logic to filter rules.
*   Outputting the refined set of active rules.

## Naming Conventions

*   **Class Name:** [`RuleEngine`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:9) follows PascalCase, which is standard for Python classes (PEP 8).
*   **Method Names:** [`__init__`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:10), [`generate_rules`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:16), [`evaluate_rules`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:23), [`prune_rules`](pipeline/rule_engine.py:30) use snake_case, which is standard for Python functions and methods (PEP 8).
*   **Module Name:** `rule_engine.py` uses snake_case, which is standard for Python modules.

The naming conventions appear consistent and follow PEP 8. No obvious AI assumption errors or deviations were noted in the existing stub code.
