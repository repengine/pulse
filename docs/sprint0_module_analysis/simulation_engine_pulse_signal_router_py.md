# Module Analysis: `simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of [`simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:) is to route incoming symbolic, narrative, or signal-driven events to modify the Pulse system's `WorldState`. It acts as a translator, converting string-based signals (e.g., "ai_panic", "fed_cut") into specific, predefined changes within the simulation's state. These changes can include updates to worldstate variables, adjustments to symbolic overlays (like "despair" or "hope"), and modifications to capital allocations in simulated assets.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operational and functionally complete for the set of signals currently defined within it.
- It has a clear, dictionary-based mechanism ([`_signal_handlers`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:74)) for mapping signals to handler functions.
- Each handler function implements specific state changes.
- Basic error handling (e.g., for unknown signals, missing attributes in `WorldState`) is present.
- A simple inline test function, [`_test_route_signal`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:113), demonstrates basic functionality and suggests a level of completeness for its current scope.
- There are no explicit "TODO" comments or obvious placeholders for core functionality.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Limited Extensibility for Handlers:** While adding new signal strings to [`_signal_handlers`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:74) is straightforward, the corresponding handler functions (e.g., [`_ai_panic`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:26), [`_fed_cut`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:34)) are hardcoded as private functions within the module. A more extensible design might involve a plugin system or dynamic loading of handlers from other modules or configuration files.
- **Signal Granularity:** Some signals map to the same handler (e.g., "ai_panic", "openai_collapse", "ai_regulation_spike" all use [`_ai_panic`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:26)). Future development might require more differentiated responses for these distinct events.
- **Configuration-Driven Signals:** The signals, their effects (variable changes, overlay adjustments, capital nudges), and the magnitudes of these changes are all hardcoded. Moving this logic to external configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON) would allow for easier modification and expansion without code changes.
- **`WorldState` Variable Dependency:** The handlers rely on specific variables existing within `state.variables`. The `try-except AttributeError` blocks (e.g., lines [30-32](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:30-32)) suggest that these variables might not always be present. A more formal schema for [`WorldstateVariables`](../../simulation_engine/variables/worldstate_variables.py:) or more robust handling of missing variables could be a future improvement.
- **Repetitive Error Handling:** The `AttributeError` checking in each handler is repetitive. This could be refactored, perhaps using a decorator or a helper function, to make the code DRYer.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Project Module Imports:
- [`engine.worldstate`](../../simulation_engine/worldstate.py:21): Specifically, the `WorldState` class.
- [`engine.state_mutation`](../../simulation_engine/state_mutation.py:22): Functions [`adjust_overlay`](../../simulation_engine/state_mutation.py:) and [`adjust_capital`](../../simulation_engine/state_mutation.py:).
- [`engine.variables.worldstate_variables`](../../simulation_engine/variables/worldstate_variables.py:23): The `WorldstateVariables` class (though an instance is accessed via `state.variables`).

### External Library Dependencies:
- `logging` (Python standard library)
- `typing` (Python standard library: `Callable`, `Dict`)

### Shared Data Interactions:
- The module primarily interacts with other parts of the system by modifying the `WorldState` object passed to its [`route_signal`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:87) function. This object is presumed to be a central data structure shared across the simulation engine.

### Input/Output Files:
- The module does not directly read from or write to files, apart from generating log messages via the `logging` module.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

### `route_signal(state: WorldState, signal: str) -> bool`
- **Purpose:** The main public function of the module. It takes the current `WorldState` and a signal string as input, looks up the appropriate handler for the signal, and executes it to modify the `WorldState`.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```python
  from engine.worldstate import WorldState
  from engine.pulse_signal_router import route_signal

  # Assume s is an initialized WorldState object
  s = WorldState()
  s.variables.ai_policy_risk = 0.0
  s.variables.fed_funds_rate = 1.0
  # ... initialize other relevant variables for specific signals

  signal_event = "ai_panic"
  was_handled = route_signal(s, signal_event)

  if was_handled:
      print(f"Signal '{signal_event}' processed successfully.")
      # WorldState 's' is now modified
  else:
      print(f"Signal '{signal_event}' was not recognized or an error occurred.")
  ```

### Signal Handler Functions (e.g., `_ai_panic(state)`, `_fed_cut(state)`)
- **Purpose:** These are private helper functions, each designed to implement the specific state changes associated with a particular category of signal. They are not intended for direct external use.
- **Internal Usage:** Called by [`route_signal`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:87) through the [`_signal_handlers`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:74) dictionary.
  ```python
  # Inside _ai_panic(state):
  # adjust_overlay(state, "despair", +0.02)
  # state.variables.ai_policy_risk = min(1.0, state.variables.ai_policy_risk + 0.2)
  ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

- **Signal Definitions:** The mapping of signal strings to handler functions in [`_signal_handlers`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:74-85) is entirely hardcoded.
- **Overlay Names:** Symbolic overlay names (e.g., "despair", "fatigue", "hope", "trust") are hardcoded strings within each handler function when calling [`adjust_overlay`](../../simulation_engine/state_mutation.py:).
- **Capital Adjustment Targets:** Asset symbols/tickers (e.g., "spy", "msft", "ibit", "nvda") are hardcoded strings within handlers when calling [`adjust_capital`](../../simulation_engine/state_mutation.py:).
- **Numerical Values:** All numerical constants used for adjustments (e.g., overlay changes like `+0.02`, variable modifications like `+0.2`, capital amounts like `+400`) are hardcoded.
- **Variable Attribute Names:** The specific names of variables within `state.variables` (e.g., `ai_policy_risk`, `fed_funds_rate`, `crypto_instability`) are hardcoded when accessed or modified.
- **Min/Max Boundaries:** Clamping values (e.g., `min(1.0, ...)` or `max(0.0, ...)`) for variable adjustments are hardcoded.

## 7. Coupling Points

- **`WorldState` Object:** Tightly coupled to the structure and expected attributes of the `WorldState` object, particularly its `variables` attribute (assumed to be an instance of `WorldstateVariables`).
- **`state_mutation` Module:** Directly depends on the [`adjust_overlay`](../../simulation_engine/state_mutation.py:) and [`adjust_capital`](../../simulation_engine/state_mutation.py:) functions from the [`engine.state_mutation`](../../simulation_engine/state_mutation.py:) module. Changes to the API of these functions would break this router.
- **`WorldstateVariables` Schema:** Implicitly coupled to the expected schema (available attributes and their types) of the [`WorldstateVariables`](../../simulation_engine/variables/worldstate_variables.py:) class. The handlers expect certain variables to exist and be of a numeric type.

## 8. Existing Tests

- An inline test function, [`_test_route_signal()`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:113-127), is present within the module.
- **Nature of Tests:** It performs basic assertion checks for a few known signals ("ai_panic", "fed_cut") and one unknown signal to ensure `route_signal` returns the expected boolean. It initializes a `WorldState` and populates some necessary variables for the tests.
- **Coverage:** Limited. It does not cover all defined signals or handlers. It doesn't test edge cases for the variable modifications (e.g., boundary conditions beyond simple min/max) or the behavior if `adjust_overlay`/`adjust_capital` were to fail.
- **Gaps:**
    - Not part of a formal test suite (e.g., using `pytest`). A dedicated test file like `tests/test_pulse_signal_router.py` is not indicated in the project structure, suggesting formal unit tests for this module might be missing or located elsewhere.
    - The test only checks the return value of `route_signal` and implicitly that no exceptions are raised for handled signals. It does not explicitly assert the state changes within `WorldState` (e.g., that `ai_policy_risk` was actually incremented).

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

- **Architecture:**
    - The core is a dispatch mechanism using the `_signal_handlers` dictionary. This dictionary maps lowercase signal strings (keys) to their corresponding handler functions (values).
    - Each handler function (e.g., [`_ai_panic`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:26)) encapsulates the specific logic for how a signal impacts the `WorldState`. This includes direct manipulation of `state.variables` and calls to [`adjust_overlay`](../../simulation_engine/state_mutation.py:) and [`adjust_capital`](../../simulation_engine/state_mutation.py:) from the `state_mutation` module.
- **Control Flow:**
    1. The public function [`route_signal(state, signal)`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:87) is called.
    2. Input `signal` is validated to be a string and converted to lowercase.
    3. The lowercase signal is used as a key to look up a handler function in [`_signal_handlers`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:74).
    4. If a handler is found:
        a. The handler is executed with the `state` object.
        b. The handler modifies `state.variables`, and calls `adjust_overlay` and/or `adjust_capital`.
        c. Success is logged, and `True` is returned.
        d. If an exception occurs during handler execution, it's caught, logged, and `False` is returned.
    5. If no handler is found, a warning is logged, and `False` is returned.

## 10. Naming Conventions

- **Functions:** Adheres to PEP 8, using `snake_case` for function names (e.g., [`route_signal`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:87), [`_ai_panic`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:26)). Private helper functions are correctly prefixed with a single underscore.
- **Variables:** Local variables also use `snake_case` (e.g., `sig`, `handler`).
- **Dictionary:** [`_signal_handlers`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:74) is appropriately named for a private, module-level mapping.
- **Signal Strings:** Keys in [`_signal_handlers`](../../simulation_engine/pulse_signal_router.py:74) are lowercase strings with underscores (e.g., "ai_panic", "fed_cut"), promoting consistency.
- **Clarity:** Names are generally descriptive and easy to understand.
- **Potential AI Deviations:** The authorship "Pulse v0.4" suggests AI involvement. However, the naming conventions are standard and do not exhibit unusual patterns often seen in purely AI-generated code. The code is quite readable. The repetition in `AttributeError` handling is more of a structural observation than a naming issue.
