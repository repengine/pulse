# Module Analysis: `simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py`](simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:1) module is to process historical signal data, retrieved via an Iris plugin (specifically [`historical_ingestion_plugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.py:13)), and transform this data into a series of per-turn [`WorldState`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:7) snapshots. These snapshots, representing the state of the simulation world at discrete historical points, are then serialized and saved as individual JSON files.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its defined task. It handles command-line argument parsing for the output directory, loads necessary Iris plugins, fetches historical data, iterates through time-stamped signal sets, populates [`WorldState`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:7) objects, and saves them. Basic error checks are in place, such as verifying the presence of the required historical plugin and checking for essential keys in signal data. No "TODO" or "FIXME" comments indicating unfinished work were found.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **No Obvious Gaps:** The module fulfills its specific purpose of converting a historical signal timeline into snapshots.
*   **Potential Enhancements (Out of Current Scope):**
    *   More granular error reporting and logging, perhaps to a dedicated log file instead of just `print` statements.
    *   Support for configurable data sources or alternative historical plugins beyond the hard-referenced [`historical_ingestion_plugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.py:13).
    *   Options to filter signals or select specific time ranges for snapshot generation.
    *   Integration with a database or a more structured storage system for snapshots, rather than individual JSON files, for larger datasets.
*   **Development Path:** The module seems to follow a direct implementation path for its intended functionality without signs of deviation or premature termination of features.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Project Module Imports:
*   [`engine.worldstate.WorldState`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:7)
*   [`core.variable_accessor.set_variable`](core/variable_accessor.py:8)
*   [`engine.utils.worldstate_io.save_worldstate_to_file`](simulation_engine/utils/worldstate_io.py:9)
*   [`ingestion.iris_plugins.IrisPluginManager`](iris/iris_plugins.py:11)
*   [`ingestion.iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.historical_ingestion_plugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.py:13)
*   [`ingestion.iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.HISTORY_SNAPSHOT_PREFIX`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.py:13) (Constant)

### External Library Dependencies:
*   `argparse` (Python standard library)
*   `json` (Python standard library)
*   `os` (Python standard library)

### Interactions via Shared Data:
*   **Primary Interaction:** Consumes data produced by the [`historical_ingestion_plugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.py:13). This plugin is expected to return a list (timeline) where each item is a list of signal dictionaries for a specific "turn". Each signal dictionary must contain "name" and "value" keys.

### Input/Output Files:
*   **Input:** Implicitly relies on the data source(s) accessed by the [`historical_ingestion_plugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.py:13). The specifics of these sources are external to this module.
*   **Output:** Generates multiple JSON files, each representing a [`WorldState`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:7) snapshot for a historical turn.
    *   **Directory:** Specified by the `--output-dir` command-line argument (defaults to `snapshots/`).
    *   **Filename Pattern:** `"{HISTORY_SNAPSHOT_PREFIX}{turn:04d}.json"` (e.g., `historical_snapshot_0001.json`). The `HISTORY_SNAPSHOT_PREFIX` is imported from [`ingestion.iris_plugins_variable_ingestion`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.py:13).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module is designed to be run as a command-line script.

*   **`parse_args()`**:
    ```python
    # Called internally by main()
    args = parse_args()
    output_dir = args.output_dir
    ```
    This function configures and parses command-line arguments, primarily to get the `--output-dir`.

*   **`main()`**:
    The main execution function. It can be invoked by running the script:
    ```bash
    python simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py --output-dir path/to/your/snapshots
    ```
    If `--output-dir` is not provided, it defaults to creating a `snapshots` directory in the current working directory.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Output Directory:** The default value for `--output-dir` is hardcoded to `"snapshots"` within the [`argparse`](simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:3) setup ([`simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:21`](simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:21)).
*   **Specific Plugin Reference:** The script explicitly searches for the `historical_ingestion_plugin` function object: `if plugin == historical_ingestion_plugin:` ([`simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:40`](simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:40)). This creates a tight dependency on this specific plugin implementation rather than a more abstract lookup (e.g., by a registered name).
*   **Filename Structure:** The output filename structure `f"{HISTORY_SNAPSHOT_PREFIX}{turn:04d}.json"` ([`simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:66`](simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:66)) is fixed, though the prefix itself is imported.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Iris Plugin System:** Tightly coupled with [`ingestion.iris_plugins.IrisPluginManager`](iris/iris_plugins.py:11) and specifically relies on the existence and output format of [`ingestion.iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.historical_ingestion_plugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.py:13).
*   **WorldState Module:** Dependent on the [`WorldState`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:7) class from [`engine.worldstate`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:7) for creating state snapshots.
*   **Core Utilities:** Relies on [`core.variable_accessor.set_variable`](core/variable_accessor.py:8) for populating the `WorldState` and [`engine.utils.worldstate_io.save_worldstate_to_file`](simulation_engine/utils/worldstate_io.py:9) for saving it.
*   **Data Format:** Expects the historical data (signals) to be a list of dictionaries, each with "name" and "value" keys, as per processing loop at [`simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:57-62`](simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:57-62).

## 8. Existing Tests

*   Based on the available project file structure, there is no dedicated test file specifically for `ingest_to_snapshots.py` (e.g., `tests/simulation_engine/utils/test_ingest_to_snapshots.py`).
*   Testing this module would typically involve:
    *   Mocking the [`IrisPluginManager`](iris/iris_plugins.py:11) and the [`historical_ingestion_plugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.py:13) to return controlled test data.
    *   Verifying that the correct number of snapshot files are created in the specified output directory.
    *   Checking the content of the generated JSON snapshot files to ensure they accurately reflect the input signal data and [`WorldState`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:7) structure.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module follows a sequential script-like execution flow:

1.  **Argument Parsing:** The [`parse_args()`](simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:15) function retrieves the output directory from command-line arguments.
2.  **Directory Setup:** The output directory is created if it doesn't already exist using [`os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)`](simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:30).
3.  **Plugin Initialization & Lookup:**
    *   An [`IrisPluginManager`](iris/iris_plugins.py:11) instance is created and plugins are autoloaded.
    *   The script iterates through loaded plugins to find the specific [`historical_ingestion_plugin`](iris/iris_plugins_variable_ingestion.py:13) function object. If not found, an error is printed, and the script exits.
4.  **Historical Data Retrieval:** The located [`historical_plugin_fn()`](simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:50) is called, which is expected to return a timeline (list of lists) of historical signals.
5.  **Snapshot Generation Loop:** The script iterates through the `historical_signals_timeline` using `enumerate` to get a turn number.
    *   For each `turn` and its `signals_for_date`:
        *   A new [`WorldState`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:7) object is instantiated.
        *   Each signal (`sig`) in `signals_for_date` is processed:
            *   It checks if `sig` contains "name" and "value" keys.
            *   If valid, [`set_variable(state, sig["name"], sig["value"])`](simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:60) is used to update the `WorldState`.
            *   Invalid signals trigger a warning.
        *   A filename is generated using `HISTORY_SNAPSHOT_PREFIX` and the formatted turn number (e.g., `historical_snapshot_0001.json`).
        *   [`save_worldstate_to_file(state, output_dir, filename=filename)`](simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:67) saves the current `WorldState` to the designated file.
        *   Progress is printed every 100 snapshots.
6.  **Completion Message:** A final message indicates the completion of snapshot generation.
7.  **Script Execution:** The [`main()`](simulation_engine/utils/ingest_to_snapshots.py:26) function is called if the script is run directly (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
