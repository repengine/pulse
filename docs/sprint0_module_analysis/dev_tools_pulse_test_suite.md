# Module Analysis: `dev_tools/pulse_test_suite.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary purpose of the [`dev_tools/pulse_test_suite.py`](dev_tools/pulse_test_suite.py:1) module is to validate core mechanics of the Pulse simulation engine. Specifically, it focuses on:

*   Verifying that symbolic overlays change over a series of simulated turns.
*   Ensuring that capital exposure shifts as expected during the simulation.

It acts as a basic integration or smoke test to confirm that the rule engines are actively modifying the simulation's state.

## 2. Key Functionalities

*   **`test_symbolic_shift(threshold=0.01, turns=5)`**:
    *   Initializes a `WorldState` object.
    *   Captures the initial state of symbolic overlays.
    *   Runs the simulation for a specified number of `turns` using the [`run_turn()`](simulation_engine/turn_engine.py:0) function.
    *   Compares the final state of symbolic overlays against the initial state.
    *   Logs whether each overlay component has changed by more than a given `threshold`.
*   **`test_capital_shift(threshold=1.0, turns=5)`**:
    *   Similar to `test_symbolic_shift`, but focuses on changes in capital exposure within the `WorldState`.
    *   Captures initial capital allocation.
    *   Runs the simulation for a specified number of `turns`.
    *   Compares final capital allocation against the initial state.
    *   Logs whether each capital component has shifted by more than a given `threshold`.
*   **Script Execution (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**:
    *   When executed directly, the script runs both [`test_symbolic_shift()`](dev_tools/pulse_test_suite.py:16) and [`test_capital_shift()`](dev_tools/pulse_test_suite.py:32) with their default parameter values.

## 3. Role Within `dev_tools/` Directory

This module serves as a developer utility for performing quick, high-level validation of the simulation engine's fundamental behavior. It is likely used during development to:

*   Detect regressions in state modification logic.
*   Confirm that core components like `WorldState` and `run_turn` are interacting as expected to produce state changes.

## 4. Dependencies

### Internal Pulse Modules:

*   [`engine.worldstate.WorldState`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:0): Used to create and manage the simulation's state.
*   [`engine.turn_engine.run_turn`](simulation_engine/turn_engine.py:0): Used to advance the simulation by one turn.
*   [`utils.log_utils.get_logger`](utils/log_utils.py:0): Used for logging test progress and results.

### External Libraries:

*   No direct external library dependencies are explicitly imported, beyond standard Python libraries that might be used by the imported Pulse modules.

## 5. Adherence to SPARC Principles

*   **Module Intent/Purpose:**
    *   Clearly stated in the module docstring: "Validates symbolic overlay movement and capital exposure shifts over time to ensure rule engines are modifying state." This aligns with the SPARC principle of clarity.
*   **Operational Status/Completeness:**
    *   The module is operational for its defined, limited scope. It executes two distinct tests.
    *   "Completeness" is relative; as a basic "drift" or "smoke" test, it's functional. As a comprehensive test suite, it's minimal.
*   **Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps:**
    *   **Lack of Assertions:** The tests rely on logging (`logger.info`) to indicate changes, rather than using formal `assert` statements typical of test frameworks like `pytest`. This means test "failure" (e.g., no change when one is expected) is a matter of log interpretation rather than automated test runner failure.
    *   **Basic Validation:** It checks *if* a change occurred beyond a threshold, but not *what* the change should be or if the change is *correct* according to specific simulation rules or inputs.
    *   **Hardcoded Thresholds/Turns:** Default values for `threshold` and `turns` are hardcoded in function signatures. More robust testing might involve parameterization or configuration.
    *   **Potential for Expansion:** Could be expanded to include more specific test scenarios, different initial states, or validation against expected outcomes.
*   **Connections & Dependencies:**
    *   Dependencies are clearly defined through imports and are focused on core simulation components (`WorldState`, `run_turn`) and logging.
*   **Function and Class Example Usages:**
    *   The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block provides a clear example of how to run the tests:
        ```python
        # From dev_tools/pulse_test_suite.py:48
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            test_symbolic_shift()
            test_capital_shift()
        ```
    *   Functions can be called with non-default parameters:
        ```python
        test_symbolic_shift(threshold=0.05, turns=10)
        test_capital_shift(threshold=0.5, turns=10)
        ```
*   **Hardcoding Issues:**
    *   Default `threshold` and `turns` values in function parameters.
    *   The logic for "significant change" is tied to these defaults.
*   **Coupling Points:**
    *   Tightly coupled to the structure of the `WorldState` object, particularly how overlays and capital are accessed (e.g., `state.overlays.as_dict()`, `state.capital.as_dict()`). Changes to these `WorldState` aspects would necessitate updates in this test suite.
    *   Dependent on the behavior and interface of the `run_turn` function.
*   **Existing Tests:**
    *   This module *is* a test suite. It does not appear to have separate unit tests for its own logic, which is common for test utility scripts of this nature.
*   **Module Architecture and Flow:**
    1.  Imports.
    2.  Logger initialization.
    3.  `test_symbolic_shift` function:
        *   Initialize `WorldState`.
        *   Store initial overlay state.
        *   Loop `turns` times, calling `run_turn()`.
        *   Get final overlay state.
        *   Calculate differences and log them, indicating if they exceed the threshold.
    4.  `test_capital_shift` function:
        *   Similar flow as above, but for capital state.
    5.  Main execution block: Calls both test functions.
    The architecture is simple and sequential for each test.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   Module name (`pulse_test_suite.py`) is descriptive.
    *   Function names ([`test_symbolic_shift()`](dev_tools/pulse_test_suite.py:16), [`test_capital_shift()`](dev_tools/pulse_test_suite.py:32)) clearly describe their actions and follow Python's snake_case convention.
    *   Variable names (`state`, `initial`, `final`, `changes`, `delta`) are clear and conventional.

## 6. Overall Assessment

*   **Completeness:**
    *   For its stated purpose as a basic check that the simulation engine modifies state, the module is functionally complete.
    *   It is not a comprehensive test suite and lacks depth in validating the *correctness* of state changes.
*   **Quality:**
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   Simple, readable, and easy to understand.
        *   Directly addresses its intended goal of verifying state modification.
        *   Uses logging for output, which can be helpful for development.
    *   **Areas for Improvement:**
        *   **Test Assertions:** Should integrate with a formal testing framework (like `pytest`, which seems to be used elsewhere in the project) by using `assert` statements. This would allow for automated pass/fail status and integration into CI/CD pipelines.
        *   **Specificity:** The tests are very general. They could be improved by testing specific scenarios or the impact of specific rules.
        *   **Parameterization:** Test scenarios could be made more flexible by parameterizing inputs or expected outcomes rather than relying solely on hardcoded defaults.
        *   **Clarity of "Failure":** The "barely changed" log messages are informative but don't constitute a formal test failure in an automated sense.

## 7. Note for Main Report

The `dev_tools/pulse_test_suite.py` module provides basic "smoke tests" to confirm that symbolic overlays and capital exposure change during simulation, but it lacks formal assertions and detailed validation of the changes' correctness.
