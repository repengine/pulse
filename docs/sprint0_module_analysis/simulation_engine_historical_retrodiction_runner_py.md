# Module Analysis: `simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py`

## Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of [`simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:1) is to serve as a **compatibility layer**. Its functionality was deprecated and merged into [`simulation_engine/simulator_core.py`](../../simulation_engine/simulator_core.py). This module exists solely to maintain backward compatibility with existing tests, specifically [`tests/test_historical_retrodiction_runner.py`](../../tests/test_historical_retrodiction_runner.py).

## Operational Status/Completeness

The module is **complete** in its intended function as a compatibility layer. It does not contain obvious placeholders or TODOs related to its current, limited scope. The docstrings clearly state its deprecated nature and purpose.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **No Gaps for Current Purpose:** Given its role as a compatibility shim, there are no implementation gaps.
*   **Original Intent Superseded:** The module's original, more extensive functionality related to historical retrodiction running is now handled by [`simulation_engine/simulator_core.py`](../../simulation_engine/simulator_core.py). Development on its original path has stopped, and it has been intentionally reduced.
*   **No Implied Follow-ups:** There are no implied next steps for this module itself, as its purpose is to be a static compatibility interface.

## Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from Other Project Modules:** None.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   `os` (standard library)
    *   `json` (standard library)
    *   `typing` (standard library: `Dict`, `Any`, `Optional`)
    *   `pathlib` (standard library: `Path`)
*   **Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data:**
    *   Reads from a JSON file specified by the `PULSE_TRUTH_PATH` environment variable, defaulting to `data/historical_variables.json`. This file is expected to contain historical variable states and snapshots.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** `data/historical_variables.json` (default path, configurable via `PULSE_TRUTH_PATH` environment variable). This file is expected to contain a dictionary with keys like "variables" and "snapshots".
    *   **Output:** None directly, other than returning data read from the input file.

## Function and Class Example Usages

*   **[`get_default_variable_state()`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:17):**
    *   **Purpose:** Retrieves a default dictionary of variable states. It attempts to load this from the `TRUTH_PATH` file. If the file doesn't exist, isn't valid JSON, or doesn't contain the expected 'variables' key, it returns a hardcoded default: `{"energy_cost": 1.0}`.
    *   **Usage (Conceptual):**
        ```python
        # from engine.historical_retrodiction_runner import get_default_variable_state
        # default_vars = get_default_variable_state()
        # print(default_vars)
        ```

*   **[`RetrodictionLoader`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:39):**
    *   **Purpose:** A compatibility class that loads "snapshots" from the `TRUTH_PATH` file.
    *   **[`__init__(self, path: Optional[str] = None)`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:44):** Initializes the loader, optionally taking a custom path or defaulting to `TRUTH_PATH`. It loads snapshot data from the JSON file if it exists.
    *   **[`get_snapshot_by_turn(self, turn: int) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:55):** Retrieves a specific snapshot dictionary for a given turn number (as a string key) from the loaded snapshots.
    *   **Usage (Conceptual):**
        ```python
        # from engine.historical_retrodiction_runner import RetrodictionLoader
        # loader = RetrodictionLoader() # Uses default TRUTH_PATH
        # snapshot_for_turn_5 = loader.get_snapshot_by_turn(5)
        # if snapshot_for_turn_5:
        #     print(snapshot_for_turn_5)
        ```

## Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Path:** The `TRUTH_PATH` defaults to [`'data/historical_variables.json'`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:15). While configurable via an environment variable (`PULSE_TRUTH_PATH`), the default is hardcoded.
*   **Fallback Variable State:** In [`get_default_variable_state()`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:17), if loading from file fails, it returns a hardcoded dictionary: [`{"energy_cost": 1.0}`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:37).
*   **JSON Keys:** The code expects specific keys in the JSON data, such as [`'variables'`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:30) and [`'snapshots'`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:51).

## Coupling Points

*   **File-Based Coupling:** The primary coupling is through the JSON file defined by `TRUTH_PATH`. The structure and content of this file are critical for the module's operation.
*   **Environment Variable Coupling:** The `PULSE_TRUTH_PATH` environment variable provides a configuration point.
*   **Test Dependency:** The module is tightly coupled to the existence and requirements of [`tests/test_historical_retrodiction_runner.py`](../../tests/test_historical_retrodiction_runner.py), as this is its sole reason for existence.

## Existing Tests

*   A corresponding test file, [`tests/test_historical_retrodiction_runner.py`](../../tests/test_historical_retrodiction_runner.py), exists.
*   The docstring explicitly states: "This file exists to maintain backward compatibility with existing tests." ([`simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:5-6`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:5)).
*   The nature of these tests would likely be to ensure that the compatibility layer correctly loads and provides data as the original module did, using a test version of the `historical_variables.json` file.

## Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Initialization:**
    *   The `TRUTH_PATH` constant is defined, attempting to read from the `PULSE_TRUTH_PATH` environment variable or using a default.
*   **[`get_default_variable_state()`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:17):**
    1.  Tries to open and read `TRUTH_PATH`.
    2.  Parses JSON data.
    3.  If successful and 'variables' key exists, returns `data['variables']`. Otherwise, returns the full data if it's a dict.
    4.  On any exception or if conditions aren't met, returns `{"energy_cost": 1.0}`.
*   **[`RetrodictionLoader`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:39) Class:**
    *   **[`__init__`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:44):**
        1.  Sets `self.path` to the provided path or `TRUTH_PATH`.
        2.  Initializes `self.snapshots` to an empty dictionary.
        3.  Tries to open and read `self.path`.
        4.  Parses JSON data.
        5.  If successful, sets `self.snapshots` to `data.get('snapshots', {})`.
        6.  Exceptions during file operations are caught silently.
    *   **[`get_snapshot_by_turn()`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:55):**
        1.  Returns `self.snapshots.get(str(turn))`, looking up the snapshot by the string representation of the turn number.

The flow is straightforward: load data from a predefined or environment-specified JSON file and provide access to parts of that data through a function and a class method. Error handling for file operations is present (try-except blocks), generally leading to default/empty values.

## Naming Conventions

*   **Constants:** `TRUTH_PATH` is in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, which is standard for Python constants.
*   **Functions:** [`get_default_variable_state`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:17) is in `snake_case`, following PEP 8.
*   **Classes:** [`RetrodictionLoader`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:39) is in `PascalCase` (or `CapWords`), following PEP 8.
*   **Methods:** [`__init__`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:44), [`get_snapshot_by_turn`](../../simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:55) are in `snake_case`, following PEP 8.
*   **Variables:** `path`, `data`, `f`, `snapshots`, `turn` are generally in `snake_case` or are single letters for file handles, which is acceptable.
*   **Type Hinting:** Uses standard types from the `typing` module (`Dict`, `Any`, `Optional`).

The naming conventions appear consistent and follow PEP 8. There are no obvious AI assumption errors or major deviations.
