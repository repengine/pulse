# Module Analysis: `operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`

**Version:** v1.0.0
**Author:** Pulse AI Engine

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py) module is to generate a concise Markdown-formatted summary, referred to as an "Operator Brief." This brief synthesizes information from recent simulation forecasts, including alignment scores, symbolic arc distributions, symbolic tag distributions, drift analysis between simulation cycles (both for symbolic arcs and overall simulation behavior), and basic risk observations. It is designed to provide operators with a quick overview of the system's state and recent changes.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operationally complete for its defined scope (v1.0.0).
- It handles optional input files and provides default values for parameters like output path ([`operator_brief.md`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:35)) and the number of top forecasts to display (`top_k=5`).
- Basic error handling is implemented for file loading operations and the main report generation process, printing messages to the console upon failure.
- It successfully generates a multi-section Markdown report.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Risk Analysis Sophistication:** The "Risk Observations" section (lines 145-154 of [`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:145)) is currently based on simple, hardcoded thresholds for `arc_stability` and `novelty`. This could be significantly enhanced with more sophisticated risk metrics, configurable thresholds, or integration with a dedicated risk assessment module.
- **Configurability:**
    - Thresholds for risk metrics ([`arc_stability < 0.6`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:150), [`novelty < 0.5`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:152)) are hardcoded. These could be made configurable, perhaps via a configuration file or command-line arguments.
    - The content and structure of the Markdown report are fixed. Future enhancements might include templating or more customization options.
- **Input Data Schema Reliance:** The module implicitly relies on specific key names within the input JSONL files (e.g., `alignment_score`, `symbolic_tag`). While common, this makes it sensitive to schema changes in upstream data sources.
- **No explicit TODOs** are present in the code.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Project Module Imports:
-   [`trust_system.forecast_episode_logger.summarize_episodes`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:0) (line 16 of [`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:16)): Used to summarize symbolic episodes from log files for drift calculation.
-   [`engine.simulation_drift_detector.run_simulation_drift_analysis`](simulation_engine/simulation_drift_detector.py:0) (line 19 of [`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:19)): Used to perform drift analysis between two simulation traces.

### External Library Dependencies:
-   `json` (standard library): For loading data from JSONL files.
-   `datetime` (standard library): For timestamping the generated report.
-   `typing` (standard library): For type hinting (`List`, `Dict`, `Optional`).
-   `os` (standard library): Used for path existence checks ([`os.path.exists`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:57)).

### Interaction via Shared Data:
The module interacts with other parts of the system primarily through files:
-   **Input Files (JSONL format expected for logs):**
    -   `alignment_file` (optional): Contains alignment-scored forecasts.
    -   `episode_log_file` (optional): Contains symbolic episode logs for the current cycle.
    -   `previous_episode_log` (optional): Contains symbolic episode logs from the previous cycle, used for arc drift comparison.
    -   `prev_trace_path` (optional): Path to the previous simulation trace file.
    -   `curr_trace_path` (optional): Path to the current simulation trace file.
-   **Output Files:**
    -   `output_md_path`: The Markdown file where the operator brief is written (defaults to [`operator_brief.md`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:35)).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

### `load_jsonl(path: str) -> List[Dict]`
-   **Purpose:** Loads a JSON Lines (JSONL) file ([`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:22`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:22)), parsing each line as a separate JSON object and returning a list of dictionaries. Includes basic error handling for file operations.
-   **Example Usage (internal):**
    ```python
    forecast_data = load_jsonl("path/to/forecast_alignments.jsonl")
    episode_data = load_jsonl("path/to/episode_log.jsonl")
    ```

### `generate_operator_brief(...) -> None`
-   **Purpose:** The main function ([`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:32`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:32)) that orchestrates the loading of data, processing (drift calculation, summaries), and generation of the Markdown report.
-   **Example Invocation:**
    ```python
    from operator_interface.operator_brief_generator import generate_operator_brief

    generate_operator_brief(
        alignment_file="data/alignment_scores.jsonl",
        episode_log_file="data/current_episodes.jsonl",
        output_md_path="reports/daily_operator_brief.md",
        top_k=10,
        previous_episode_log="data/previous_episodes.jsonl",
        prev_trace_path="data/trace_v1.jsonl",
        curr_trace_path="data/trace_v2.jsonl"
    )
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **Default Output Filename:** The default output path is hardcoded as [`"operator_brief.md"`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:35), though it can be overridden via the `output_md_path` parameter.
-   **Default `top_k` Value:** The default number of top forecasts to display is hardcoded to `5` (line 36 of [`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:36)), configurable via the `top_k` parameter.
-   **Risk Thresholds:**
    -   `arc_stability` threshold: `< 0.6` (line 150 of [`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:150)).
    -   `novelty` threshold: `< 0.5` (line 152 of [`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:152)).
-   **Report Structure and Headers:** All Markdown section titles (e.g., `"# 🧠 Pulse Operator Brief"`, `"## 🔝 Top {top_k} Forecasts by Alignment"`) and the report footer (`"---\nGenerated by Pulse AI Operator Brief Generator\n"`, line 156 of [`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:156)) are hardcoded strings.
-   **Key Names for Data Extraction:** The module uses hardcoded string keys (e.g., `"alignment_score"`, `"symbolic_tag"`, `"arc_label"`, `"trace_id"`, `"confidence"`, `"alignment_components"`, `"arc_stability"`, `"novelty"`) to access data within the dictionaries loaded from JSONL files.
-   **Console Messages:** Error and success messages printed to the console are hardcoded (e.g., `"✅ Operator brief written to ..."`, `"❌ Failed to load ..."`).

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **Input Data Schemas:** The module is tightly coupled to the expected structure and key names within the input JSONL files (`alignment_file`, `episode_log_file`, trace files). Any changes to these external schemas would likely require modifications to this module.
-   **[`trust_system.forecast_episode_logger.summarize_episodes`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:0):** Dependency on the specific output structure (dictionary keys like `"arc_..."`) and functionality of this imported function.
-   **[`engine.simulation_drift_detector.run_simulation_drift_analysis`](simulation_engine/simulation_drift_detector.py:0):** Dependency on the output structure (dictionary keys like `"overlay_drift"`, `"rule_trigger_delta"`, `"structure_shift"`) and functionality of this imported function.
-   **Output Format:** The module is specifically designed to produce a Markdown report. If a different output format were required (e.g., HTML, JSON summary), significant changes would be needed.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   A specific test file for [`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py) (e.g., `tests/operator_interface/test_operator_brief_generator.py` or `tests/test_operator_brief_generator.py`) was not found in the initial project file listing.
-   It is assumed that dedicated unit tests for this module are currently missing or located elsewhere not immediately identifiable.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

1.  **Data Ingestion:** The [`generate_operator_brief`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:32) function begins by loading data from optional input files (`alignment_file`, `episode_log_file`) using the helper function [`load_jsonl`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:22).
2.  **Symbolic Arc Drift Calculation:** If `previous_episode_log` and `episode_log_file` are provided and valid, it computes the change in symbolic arc frequencies by calling [`summarize_episodes`](trust_system/forecast_episode_logger.py:0) on both logs and comparing the results (lines 57-66 of [`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:57-66)).
3.  **Simulation Drift Analysis:** If `prev_trace_path` and `curr_trace_path` are provided, it calls [`run_simulation_drift_analysis`](simulation_engine/simulation_drift_detector.py:0) to get a report on simulation drift (lines 69-79 of [`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:69-79)).
4.  **Markdown Report Generation:**
    *   The function opens the specified `output_md_path`.
    *   It writes a main title and a generation timestamp.
    *   **Top Forecasts:** If forecast data is available, it sorts them by `alignment_score` and includes the `top_k` forecasts with their score, tag, arc, and confidence.
    *   **Symbolic Arc & Tag Summary:** If episode data is available, it calculates and lists the distribution of symbolic arcs and tags.
    *   **Arc Drift Display:** If arc drift was calculated, it's added to the report.
    *   **Simulation Drift Display:** If simulation drift analysis was performed, its summary (overlay drift, rule trigger deltas, structural change) is added.
    *   **Risk Observations:** If forecast data contains `alignment_components`, it checks for low `arc_stability` or `novelty` based on hardcoded thresholds and reports these.
    *   A footer is appended to the report.
5.  **Error Handling:** The main generation logic is wrapped in a `try...except` block. File loading also has its own error handling. Errors are printed to standard output.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   **Functions and Variables:** Follow PEP 8 `snake_case` (e.g., [`generate_operator_brief()`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:32), `alignment_file`, `arc_counts`).
-   **Module Name:** [`operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py) is descriptive and uses `snake_case`.
-   **Clarity:** Names are generally clear and indicative of their purpose (e.g., `output_md_path`, `drift_summary`).
-   **Docstrings:** The module and its public functions have docstrings explaining their purpose and parameters.
-   **Author Tag:** The module header attributes authorship to "Pulse AI Engine" (line 9 of [`operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py`](operator_interface/operator_brief_generator.py:9)).
-   No significant deviations from standard Python naming conventions or potential AI-induced naming errors were observed.
