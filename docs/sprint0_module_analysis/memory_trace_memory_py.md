# Module Analysis: `memory/trace_memory.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`memory/trace_memory.py`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:) module is to provide a persistent logging and retrieval mechanism for simulation trace metadata. It acts as a central "knowledge backbone" by linking simulation traces to their corresponding forecasts, trust scores, input states, and other relevant metadata. This allows for replay, learning, and meta-evolution based on historical data.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its defined scope. It implements core functionalities for:
*   Logging new trace entries.
*   Retrieving specific traces by ID.
*   Summarizing memory contents (e.g., count, average confidence/fragility).
*   Listing all trace IDs.
*   Deleting specific traces.

There are no obvious placeholders (e.g., `pass` statements in critical functions) or "TODO" comments indicating unfinished core logic. It includes basic error handling for file operations and JSON parsing.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Scalability of Deletion/Summarization:** The current implementation of [`delete_trace()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:113) and [`summarize_memory()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:67) reads the entire log file into memory to perform operations. For very large log files (as warned in [`summarize_memory()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:91)), this could become inefficient. A more robust solution might involve a more database-like approach or an indexed file structure if performance with large datasets becomes a concern.
*   **Archiving Mechanism:** The module prints a warning ([`memory/trace_memory.py:91-92`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:91-92)) about large log files and suggests archiving, but no explicit archiving functionality is implemented within this module. This would be a logical next step.
*   **Advanced Querying:** Current retrieval is limited to fetching a single trace by its exact ID ([`get_trace()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:50)) or listing all IDs ([`list_trace_ids()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:95)). More advanced querying capabilities (e.g., by timestamp range, confidence score, symbolic tags) are not present and might be beneficial for more complex analysis or learning tasks.
*   **Data Integrity/Schema Validation:** While it handles `json.loads` errors, there's no explicit schema validation for the records being logged or retrieved. This could lead to inconsistencies if the `forecast` dictionary structure changes elsewhere in the system.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from other project modules:**
    *   [`core.path_registry.PATHS`](../../core/path_registry.py:) : Used to get the default path for the trace log file.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   `os`: Used for directory creation ([`os.makedirs()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:25), [`os.path.dirname()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:25)).
    *   `json`: Used for serializing and deserializing trace records to/from the JSONL file.
    *   `typing` (`Dict`, `Optional`, `List`): Used for type hinting.
    *   `datetime` (from `datetime`): Used to timestamp trace entries ([`datetime.utcnow()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:33)).
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:**
    *   The module's primary interaction is through the `logs/trace_memory_log.jsonl` file (or the path specified by `PATHS.get("TRACE_DB")`). Other modules would presumably call its methods to log data or retrieve it.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Output:** [`logs/trace_memory_log.jsonl`](logs/trace_memory_log.jsonl) (default path) - This file is appended to with new trace records in JSON Lines format.
    *   **Input:** [`logs/trace_memory_log.jsonl`](logs/trace_memory_log.jsonl) (default path) - This file is read from for retrieval, summarization, listing, and deletion operations.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module defines one class, [`TraceMemory`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:18).

*   **`TraceMemory(path: Optional[str] = None)`:**
    *   **Initialization:** Creates an instance of the trace memory manager. If `path` is not provided, it defaults to `PATHS.get("TRACE_DB", "logs/trace_memory_log.jsonl")`. It also ensures the directory for the log file exists.
    ```python
    from analytics.trace_memory import TraceMemory
    
    # Initialize with default path
    tm = TraceMemory()
    
    # Initialize with custom path
    # custom_tm = TraceMemory(path="custom_logs/my_trace_log.jsonl")
    ```

*   **`log_trace_entry(self, trace_id: str, forecast: Dict, input_state: Optional[Dict] = None)`:**
    *   **Usage:** Logs a new trace entry. `trace_id` is a unique identifier. `forecast` is a dictionary containing forecast details (confidence, fragility, etc.). `input_state` is an optional dictionary representing the state that led to the forecast.
    ```python
    sample_forecast_data = {
        "confidence": 0.95, 
        "fragility": 0.1,
        "confidence_status": "High",
        "arc_label": "Positive Trend",
        "certified": True,
        "symbolic_tag": "economy_up",
        "alignment_score": 0.88
    }
    initial_conditions = {"gdp_growth": 0.02, "inflation_rate": 0.015}
    
    tm.log_trace_entry(
        trace_id="sim_run_001", 
        forecast=sample_forecast_data,
        input_state=initial_conditions
    )
    ```

*   **`get_trace(self, trace_id: str) -> Optional[Dict]`:**
    *   **Usage:** Retrieves a specific trace record by its `trace_id`. Returns the record as a dictionary or `None` if not found or an error occurs.
    ```python
    retrieved_trace = tm.get_trace("sim_run_001")
    if retrieved_trace:
        print(f"Retrieved forecast confidence: {retrieved_trace.get('forecast', {}).get('confidence')}")
    else:
        print("Trace not found.")
    ```

*   **`summarize_memory(self, max_entries: int = 100) -> Dict`:**
    *   **Usage:** Provides a summary of the most recent trace entries (up to `max_entries`). The summary includes total count, average confidence, average fragility, and count of certified forecasts.
    ```python
    memory_summary = tm.summarize_memory(max_entries=50)
    print(f"Total traces in summary: {memory_summary.get('count')}")
    print(f"Average confidence: {memory_summary.get('avg_conf')}")
    ```

*   **`list_trace_ids(self) -> List[str]`:**
    *   **Usage:** Returns a list of all `trace_id` strings present in the log file.
    ```python
    all_ids = tm.list_trace_ids()
    print(f"Found {len(all_ids)} trace IDs.")
    ```

*   **`delete_trace(self, trace_id: str) -> bool`:**
    *   **Usage:** Deletes a trace record identified by `trace_id` from the log file. Returns `True` if deletion was successful (record found and removed), `False` otherwise.
    ```python
    was_deleted = tm.delete_trace("sim_run_001")
    if was_deleted:
        print("Trace 'sim_run_001' deleted successfully.")
    else:
        print("Failed to delete trace 'sim_run_001' or trace not found.")
    ```
The module also includes a `_test_trace_memory()` function ([`memory/trace_memory.py:136-148`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:136-148)) that demonstrates these usages.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Log File Path:** The `TRACE_DB_PATH` is defined as `PATHS.get("TRACE_DB", "logs/trace_memory_log.jsonl")` ([`memory/trace_memory.py:16`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:16)). While it uses `PATHS.get` which allows for configuration, it has a hardcoded fallback `"logs/trace_memory_log.jsonl"`. If `PATHS` is not configured with `"TRACE_DB"`, this default is used.
*   **Summarization `max_entries`:** The [`summarize_memory()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:67) method has a default `max_entries` of `100`. This is a parameter, so it can be overridden, but it's a default magic number.
*   **Large Log Warning Threshold:** The warning in [`summarize_memory()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:91) triggers if `len(records) > 10000`. This `10000` is a magic number.
*   **Keys in `log_trace_entry`:** The keys used to extract data from the `forecast` dictionary within [`log_trace_entry()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:27) (e.g., `"confidence"`, `"fragility"`, `"confidence_status"`, `"arc_label"`, `"certified"`, `"symbolic_tag"`, `"alignment_score"`) are hardcoded strings. Changes to the structure of the `forecast` object in other parts of the system would require updates here.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **`core.path_registry`:** Tightly coupled for resolving the default storage path. If `path_registry` changes its API or the `"TRACE_DB"` key is managed differently, this module could be affected.
*   **Forecast Object Structure:** The [`log_trace_entry()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:27) method expects specific keys in the `forecast` dictionary. This creates a data coupling with whatever module produces these forecast objects.
*   **File Format (JSONL):** The module is built around storing data in a JSON Lines text file. Any external tool or module interacting directly with this file must adhere to this format. Changes to this format (e.g., moving to a binary format or a different serialization method) would require significant changes here and in any interacting components.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   **Internal Test Function:** The module includes a `_test_trace_memory()` function ([`memory/trace_memory.py:136-148`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:136-148)) which performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update via re-log, Delete) operations and summarization. This function is executed if the script is run directly (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
*   **No Dedicated Test File:** Based on the file listing of the `tests/` directory, there does not appear to be a separate test file (e.g., `tests/test_trace_memory.py`) for this module. This means testing might not be integrated into a larger test suite (like one run by `pytest`) and might lack more comprehensive test cases, edge case testing, or mocking of dependencies like the file system or `PATHS`.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Architecture:** The module is class-based, with `TraceMemory` encapsulating all logic. It operates on a single JSON Lines file for persistence.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `TraceMemory` class: Manages all operations.
    *   Log file (`logs/trace_memory_log.jsonl` by default): Stores the trace data.
*   **Primary Data Flow:**
    1.  **Logging:** Data (trace ID, forecast details, input state) is passed to [`log_trace_entry()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:27), formatted into a JSON record with a timestamp, and appended to the log file.
    2.  **Retrieval/Querying:** Methods like [`get_trace()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:50), [`summarize_memory()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:67), and [`list_trace_ids()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:95) read the log file, parse JSON lines, and process them to return the requested information.
    3.  **Deletion:** [`delete_trace()`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:113) reads all lines, filters out the one to be deleted, and rewrites the file.
*   **Control Flow:**
    *   External modules instantiate `TraceMemory`.
    *   They call its public methods to interact with the trace log.
    *   Error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks for file I/O and JSON parsing) is present in most methods, typically printing an error message.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Class Name:** `TraceMemory` - Follows PascalCase, clear and descriptive.
*   **Method Names:** `log_trace_entry`, `get_trace`, `summarize_memory`, `list_trace_ids`, `delete_trace` - Follow snake_case, clear, and action-oriented. The internal test function `_test_trace_memory` uses a leading underscore, which is a common convention for internal/utility functions.
*   **Variable Names:** Generally follow snake_case (e.g., `trace_id`, `input_state`, `avg_conf`). Some abbreviations are used (e.g., `rec` for record, `f` for file handle), which are common and acceptable in small scopes.
*   **Constants:** `TRACE_DB_PATH` - Uppercase with underscores, standard for constants.
*   **PEP 8:** The module generally adheres to PEP 8 styling.
*   **Potential AI Assumption Errors/Deviations:** The author tag "Pulse v0.27" ([`memory/trace_memory.py:7`](../../memory/trace_memory.py:7)) seems to be an AI-generated or template-filled value. The naming itself within the code seems consistent and human-readable, without obvious AI-like artifacts or overly verbose/unnatural naming.
