# Analysis of trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary purpose of `trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py` is to facilitate retrodiction simulations within the Pulse system. Retrodiction involves running simulations \"backwards\" or against historical data to evaluate how well the system's models and rules would have performed. This module acts as a high-level interface for this process.

Key responsibilities include:
-   **Running Retrodiction Simulations:** Providing a primary function, [`run_retrodiction_simulation()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:25), which leverages the main simulation engine's [`simulate_forward()`](simulation_engine/simulator_core.py:45) function by configuring it to operate in a \"retrodiction mode.\" This implies that `simulate_forward` has internal logic to handle historical data injection or comparison when this mode is active.
-   **Processing and Storing Results:** Offering functions like [`save_retrodiction_results()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:56) to persist the outcomes of these retrodiction runs. This involves handling the serialization of complex data structures within the results, such as `WorldState` overlays, before storing them in a `ForecastMemory` instance dedicated to retrodiction.
-   **Forecast Persistence:** Includes a utility [`save_forecast()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:89) to store individual forecast objects, also ensuring proper serialization.
-   **Refactoring Indication:** The module's docstring explicitly states it's a refactored version intended to use the unified `simulate_forward` function, removing previous redundant retrodiction logic.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be largely complete for its refactored purpose as a wrapper and data handler for retrodiction.
-   **Core Functionality:** The main function [`run_retrodiction_simulation()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:25) correctly delegates to [`simulate_forward()`](simulation_engine/simulator_core.py:45). Data saving functions handle basic serialization needs.
-   **Memory Management:** It initializes and uses two `ForecastMemory` instances: one for general forecast history (`forecast_memory`) and another specifically for retrodiction results (`retrodiction_memory`).
-   **Testability:** Includes a local test function [`simulate_retrodiction_test()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:110) in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

-   **Signs of Intended Extension:**
    -   The `retrodiction_loader` parameter in [`run_retrodiction_simulation()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:25) is typed as `Optional[object]` and is `None` in the test. This suggests a more sophisticated mechanism for loading or providing \"ground truth\" historical data snapshots was envisioned or could be integrated. The current implementation relies on `simulate_forward` to handle this if the loader is provided.
    -   The `injection_mode` parameter (\"seed_then_free\" or \"strict_injection\") hints at different strategies for how historical data influences the retrodiction run, but the specifics of these modes are managed within `simulate_forward`.
-   **Implied but Missing Features/Modules:**
    -   **Detailed Retrodiction Analysis:** While this module runs and saves retrodiction results, it doesn't perform any analysis on them (e.g., calculating specific error metrics, comparing different retrodiction runs, generating reports). Such features would likely reside in other modules that consume the data saved by this engine.
    -   **Configuration for Memory Paths:** The `persist_dir` for `forecast_memory` is taken from `PATHS[\"FORECAST_HISTORY\"]`. However, `retrodiction_memory` is initialized without a `persist_dir`, meaning its contents are in-memory only for the session unless explicitly saved elsewhere by other means. If persistence for `retrodiction_memory` is desired, its path configuration is missing.
-   **Indications of Deviated/Stopped Development:**
    -   The module seems to be in a stable, refactored state. The removal of \"redundant manual retrodiction scoring\" indicates a successful consolidation of logic into the main simulation core.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

-   **Direct Imports from Other Project Modules:**
    -   From [`analytics.forecast_memory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:12): [`ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:24) class.
    -   From [`utils.log_utils`](utils/log_utils.py:13): [`get_logger()`](utils/log_utils.py:20).
    -   From [`core.path_registry`](core/path_registry.py:14): `PATHS` dictionary.
    -   From [`engine.worldstate`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:16): [`WorldState`](simulation_engine/worldstate.py:16) class.
    -   From [`engine.simulator_core`](simulation_engine/simulator_core.py:45): [`simulate_forward()`](simulation_engine/simulator_core.py:45) (imported locally within [`run_retrodiction_simulation`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:25)).
    -   From [`forecast_output.pfpa_logger`](forecast_output/pfpa_logger.py:114): `pfpa_memory` (imported locally within [`simulate_retrodiction_test`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:110)).
-   **External Library Dependencies:**
    -   [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html): `Dict`, `List`, `Optional`, `Any`, `Callable`.
    -   [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html): `Path` (though not directly used in a way that affects runtime beyond path definition from `PATHS`).
    -   [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html): (Implicitly used by `ForecastMemory` if it persists to JSON files, but not directly in this module's code for saving, as it delegates to `ForecastMemory.store()`).
-   **Interaction with Other Modules (Implied):**
    -   **`engine.simulator_core`:** This is a critical dependency, as [`run_retrodiction_simulation()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:25) is essentially a configured call to [`simulate_forward()`](simulation_engine/simulator_core.py:45).
    -   **Learning Modules:** Modules responsible for learning from past performance would consume the retrodiction results stored by this engine.
    -   **Data Loaders:** A `retrodiction_loader` object is expected to provide historical \"ground truth\" data to the simulation. The interface or origin of this loader is not defined within this module.
-   **Input/Output Files:**
    -   **Output:** The module uses `ForecastMemory` instances which may persist data.
        -   `forecast_memory` (instance of `ForecastMemory`) persists to the directory specified by `PATHS[\"FORECAST_HISTORY\"]`.
        -   `retrodiction_memory` (instance of `ForecastMemory`) is initialized without a `persist_dir`, so its data is in-memory unless its `store` method is called with an object that itself gets persisted by another mechanism, or if its internal `_persist_to_file` is triggered by having a `persist_dir`. The current code in [`save_retrodiction_results()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:56) calls `retrodiction_memory.store()`, which would write to files if `retrodiction_memory.persist_dir` was set.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

-   **Running a retrodiction simulation:**
    ```python
    from trust_system.retrodiction_engine import run_retrodiction_simulation, save_retrodiction_results
    from engine.worldstate import WorldState

    initial_sim_state = WorldState()
    # ... populate initial_state ...

    # Assume 'my_retro_loader' is an object that can provide historical snapshots
    # for the engine.simulator_core when in retrodiction_mode.
    my_retro_loader = None # Placeholder for an actual loader object

    retro_results = run_retrodiction_simulation(
        initial_state=initial_sim_state,
        turns=10,
        retrodiction_loader=my_retro_loader,
        logger_fn=print # Using print as a simple logger
    )
    save_retrodiction_results(retro_results)
    ```
-   **Saving an individual forecast (though typically handled by `ForecastMemory` directly):**
    ```python
    from trust_system.retrodiction_engine import save_forecast
    my_forecast = {\"trace_id\": \"fc_example_001\", \"confidence\": 0.8, \"overlays\": {\"hope\": 0.7}}
    save_forecast(my_forecast) # This uses the module-level 'forecast_memory' instance
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **`injection_mode` Default:** The default `injection_mode` in [`run_retrodiction_simulation()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:25) is \"seed_then_free\". While this is a parameter, its default value is hardcoded.
-   **Memory Instance Paths:**
    -   `forecast_memory = ForecastMemory(persist_dir=str(PATHS[\"FORECAST_HISTORY\"]))` uses a path from `PATHS`.
    -   `retrodiction_memory = ForecastMemory()` is initialized without a `persist_dir`, making its persistence behavior dependent on whether its `persist_dir` attribute is set later or if it's only used for in-session data. If long-term storage of `retrodiction_memory` is intended, its path should also be configurable.

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **[`engine.simulator_core.simulate_forward()`](simulation_engine/simulator_core.py:45):** The entire functionality of [`run_retrodiction_simulation()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:25) depends on this function and its correct behavior in \"retrodiction_mode\".
-   **[`analytics.forecast_memory.ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:24):** Used for storing results. Changes to `ForecastMemory`'s API or persistence logic could affect this module.
-   **`WorldState` Object Structure:** The module expects `WorldState` objects and specifically interacts with `overlays` that might have an `as_dict()` method. The serialization helper [`overlay_to_dict()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:63) attempts to handle this.
-   **Forecast Object Structure:** Assumes forecast dictionaries contain keys like `\"overlays\"`, `\"forks\"`, and `\"trace_id\"`.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   A local test function [`simulate_retrodiction_test()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:110) is provided in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block.
-   **Assessment:**
    -   **Pros:** Demonstrates a basic execution path of [`run_retrodiction_simulation()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:25) and [`save_retrodiction_results()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:56). It attempts to use `pfpa_memory` to check for existing forecasts before running, which is a good practice for a test.
    -   **Cons:**
        -   Relies on `pfpa_memory` having data, otherwise it skips. A test should ideally set up its own preconditions.
        -   The `retrodiction_loader` is hardcoded to `None`, so it doesn't test the scenario where actual historical data is loaded and injected.
        -   It doesn't make assertions about the content or structure of the `results` or what's saved, relying on logger output for verification.
        -   Modifies global/shared `retrodiction_memory` state.
    -   **Recommendation:** Move to a `pytest` structure. Mock dependencies like `simulate_forward` and `ForecastMemory` to isolate the logic of `retrodiction_engine.py` itself. Test with a mock `retrodiction_loader` to verify data handling. Assert the structure and content of data passed to `ForecastMemory.store()`.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

-   **Wrapper/Facade:** The module primarily acts as a facade for running retrodiction simulations via the core simulation engine.
-   **Data Handling:** It includes logic for preparing data (serializing overlays) before passing it to `ForecastMemory`.
-   **State Management:** Initializes two `ForecastMemory` instances at the module level: `forecast_memory` (for general history, configured with a persistent directory) and `retrodiction_memory` (for retrodiction-specific results, in-memory by default in this module's initialization).
-   **Control Flow:**
    1.  [`run_retrodiction_simulation()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:25) is called with an initial state and parameters.
    2.  It calls [`simulate_forward()`](simulation_engine/simulator_core.py:45) with `retrodiction_mode=True`.
    3.  The results from `simulate_forward` are returned.
    4.  These results can then be passed to [`save_retrodiction_results()`](trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py:56), which processes and stores them using the `retrodiction_memory` instance.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   **Module Name:** `retrodiction_engine.py` clearly indicates its purpose.
-   **Function Names:** `run_retrodiction_simulation`, `save_retrodiction_results`, `save_forecast` are descriptive and use `snake_case`.
-   **Variable Names:** Consistent with `snake_case` (e.g., `initial_state`, `retrodiction_loader`, `logger_fn`).
-   **Constants:** `PATHS` is used, adhering to its typical `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
-   **Overall:** Naming is clear and follows Python conventions.
