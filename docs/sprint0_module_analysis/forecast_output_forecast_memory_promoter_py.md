# Analysis Report: `forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:1) module is to select and promote high-value forecasts to a more permanent "memory" store. This selection process is based on criteria such as the forecast's "certification" status, confidence level, and strategic utility (as determined by a prioritization engine). The module acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only the most relevant and reliable forecasts are retained for longer-term use.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its defined scope.
- It has a clear main function, [`promote_to_memory()`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:15), which implements the promotion logic.
- It includes basic error handling (e.g., checking for empty input, handling exceptions during storage).
- It has logging to trace its operations using [`log_info()`](utils/log_utils.py).
- There are no obvious placeholders (e.g., `TODO`, `FIXME`) or comments indicating unfinished sections within the core logic.
- An `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:58`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:58)) provides a basic example and test case, suggesting a level of completion and internal testing.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Limited Scope of "Symbolic Integrity":** The docstring ([`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:4`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:4)) mentions promotion based on "symbolic integrity," but this aspect is not explicitly implemented or checked within the [`promote_to_memory()`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:15) function itself. This check might be assumed to be part of the "certification" process or handled by the [`rank_certified_forecasts()`](forecast_output/forecast_prioritization_engine.py) function, but it's not directly visible in this module.
- **Error Handling Granularity:** The `except Exception as e:` ([`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:49`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:49)) is broad. More specific exception handling for issues related to [`ForecastMemory().store()`](memory/forecast_memory.py) (e.g., connection errors, data validation errors if any) could be beneficial.
- **Configuration of Thresholds:** The `top_n` and `min_conf` parameters are passed to the function but could potentially be sourced from a configuration file or system-wide settings for more flexible management, rather than relying solely on caller-defined values or defaults.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Imports from Other Project Modules:
-   `from forecast_output.forecast_prioritization_engine import rank_certified_forecasts` ([`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:11`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:11)): Used to rank forecasts before promotion.
-   `from analytics.forecast_memory import ForecastMemory` ([`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:12`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:12)): Used to instantiate the memory store for saving forecasts.
-   `from utils.log_utils import log_info` ([`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:13`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:13)): Used for logging information.

### External Library Dependencies:
-   `typing` (standard library): Used for type hinting (`List`, `Dict`).

### Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data:
-   **Input:** Receives a list of forecast dictionaries (`forecasts: List[Dict]`). The structure of these dictionaries (e.g., keys like `"certified"`, `"confidence"`, `"arc_label"`, `"alignment_score"`) is implicitly defined by upstream processes that generate these forecasts.
-   **Output:** Stores selected forecast dictionaries into the `ForecastMemory` system. The specifics of this storage (e.g., database, file system) are abstracted by the [`ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py) class.

### Input/Output Files:
-   **Logs:** The module writes log messages via [`log_info()`](utils/log_utils.py). The destination of these logs depends on the `log_utils` configuration.
-   **Data Files/Database:** Interacts with the forecast memory storage system via [`ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py). This could involve writing to files or a database, but the details are abstracted.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module contains a single primary function:

### [`promote_to_memory(forecasts: List[Dict], top_n: int = 10, min_conf: float = 0.6, dry_run: bool = False) -> int`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:15)
-   **Purpose:** Filters a list of forecasts, ranks them, and stores the top N forecasts that meet a minimum confidence threshold into long-term memory.
-   **Usage Example (from the module itself):**
    ```python
    test_batch = [
        {"confidence": 0.82, "certified": True, "arc_label": "Hope Surge", "alignment_score": 0.88},
        {"confidence": 0.75, "certified": True, "arc_label": "Stabilization", "alignment_score": 0.76},
        {"confidence": 0.42, "certified": False, "arc_label": "Collapse Risk", "alignment_score": 0.51},
    ]
    # Dry run to see how many would be promoted
    count_dry_run = promote_to_memory(test_batch, top_n=2, min_conf=0.7, dry_run=True)
    print(f"{count_dry_run} forecasts would be promoted (dry run)")

    # Actual promotion
    count_promoted = promote_to_memory(test_batch, top_n=2, min_conf=0.7)
    print(f"{count_promoted} forecasts promoted")
    ```
    This example demonstrates how to call the function with a sample list of forecasts and utilize the `dry_run` parameter.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

-   **Default `top_n`:** The default value for `top_n` is `10` ([`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:15`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:15)).
-   **Default `min_conf`:** The default value for `min_conf` is `0.6` ([`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:15`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:15)).
    While these are function defaults and can be overridden, if these values are critical system parameters, they might be better managed via a central configuration mechanism.
-   **Log Message Prefixes:** Log messages use prefixes like `"[PROMOTOR]"` (e.g., [`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:29`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:29)). This is a common practice for identifying log sources but is technically a hardcoded string.

## 7. Coupling Points

-   **[`forecast_output.forecast_prioritization_engine.rank_certified_forecasts()`](forecast_output/forecast_prioritization_engine.py):** Tightly coupled for the ranking logic. Changes in the ranking function's signature or behavior could directly impact this module.
-   **[`analytics.forecast_memory.ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py):** Tightly coupled for storing forecasts. Changes to the `ForecastMemory` class's interface (especially the [`store()`](memory/forecast_memory.py) method) would require updates here.
-   **Forecast Dictionary Structure:** The module relies on a specific structure for the forecast dictionaries it processes (e.g., expecting keys like `"certified"`, `"confidence"`). Changes in this data structure from upstream modules would break this module's logic.
-   **[`utils.log_utils.log_info()`](utils/log_utils.py):** Coupled for logging.

## 8. Existing Tests

-   **In-module Test/Example:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:58`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:58)) serves as a basic, executable test and usage example. It covers a simple case with a few forecasts, including one that should be filtered out, and tests both `dry_run=True` and `dry_run=False` scenarios.
-   **External Test Files:** Based on the file listing of the [`tests`](tests:1) directory, there is no specific test file named `test_forecast_memory_promoter.py` or similar. While [`tests/test_forecast_memory.py`](tests/test_forecast_memory.py:1) exists, it would test the `ForecastMemory` class itself, not necessarily this promoter module's logic in isolation or its interaction with other components like the prioritization engine.
-   **Coverage & Gaps:**
    *   The in-module test provides minimal coverage.
    *   Edge cases are not explicitly tested (e.g., empty `certified` list after filtering, behavior when `top_n` is larger than available forecasts, various exception scenarios from `memory.store()`).
    *   Integration with a mocked or actual `ForecastMemory` and `rank_certified_forecasts` is only implicitly tested by the in-module script.
    *   A dedicated test file using a testing framework (like `pytest`) would be beneficial for more comprehensive and isolated unit/integration testing.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module has a simple, linear architecture centered around the [`promote_to_memory()`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:15) function:

1.  **Input:** A list of forecast dictionaries.
2.  **Initial Check:** If no forecasts are provided, log and return 0.
3.  **Filtering (Step 1):**
    *   Iterate through the input forecasts.
    *   Select only those forecasts that have a `certified` key set to `True` AND a `confidence` value greater than or equal to `min_conf`.
    *   If no forecasts pass this step, log and return 0.
4.  **Prioritization (Step 2):**
    *   Pass the filtered list of certified and confident forecasts to the [`rank_certified_forecasts()`](forecast_output/forecast_prioritization_engine.py) function.
    *   Take the top `top_n` forecasts from the ranked list.
5.  **Storage (Step 3):**
    *   If `dry_run` is `False`:
        *   Instantiate `ForecastMemory()`.
        *   Iterate through the prioritized `top` forecasts.
        *   Attempt to store each forecast using `memory.store(f)`.
        *   Count successfully stored forecasts.
        *   Log any errors during storage.
        *   Log the number of stored forecasts and return this count.
    *   If `dry_run` is `True`:
        *   Log the number of forecasts that *would be* promoted.
        *   Return this count.

**Data Flow:**
`List[Dict] (raw forecasts)` -> `Filter (certified & confident)` -> `List[Dict] (filtered forecasts)` -> `rank_certified_forecasts()` -> `List[Dict] (ranked & sliced top_n forecasts)` -> `ForecastMemory.store()` (if not dry_run) -> `int (count promoted)`.

## 10. Naming Conventions

-   **Module Name:** [`forecast_memory_promoter.py`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:1) (snake_case) is consistent with Python standards. The docstring has `forecast_memory_promotor.py` ([`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:2`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:2)) which is a minor typo ("promotor" vs "promoter").
-   **Function Name:** [`promote_to_memory()`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:15) (snake_case) is descriptive and follows PEP 8.
-   **Variable Names:**
    *   `forecasts`, `top_n`, `min_conf`, `dry_run`, `certified`, `top`, `memory`, `stored`, `f`, `e`, `test_batch`, `count` are generally clear and follow snake_case or are conventional (like `f` for item in loop, `e` for exception).
-   **Constants/Magic Numbers:** `10` and `0.6` are used as default values for `top_n` and `min_conf`. These are clearly named in the function signature.
-   **String Literals:** Log message prefixes like `"[PROMOTOR]"` are consistent.
-   **PEP 8 Compliance:** The code generally appears to follow PEP 8 guidelines regarding naming and style.
-   **AI Assumption Errors:** No obvious AI assumption errors in naming are apparent. The names are human-readable and contextually appropriate. The "Author: Pulse v0.26" ([`forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:7`](forecast_output/forecast_memory_promoter.py:7)) suggests AI generation or significant AI involvement, but the naming itself is standard.
