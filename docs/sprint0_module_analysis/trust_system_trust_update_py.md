# Analysis of trust_system/trust_update.py

**Module Path:** [`trust_system/trust_update.py`](trust_system/trust_update.py:497)

**Original Line Number in Inventory:** 497

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose
The primary purpose of this module is to dynamically update the \"trust weights\" associated with historical forecasts. This adjustment is based on their `retrodiction_score`, which presumably measures how well a past forecast performed when compared against actual outcomes (or a more accurate later assessment).
- It reads forecasts from a `PFPA_ARCHIVE` (Past Forecast Performance Archive).
- For each forecast, it takes the original `confidence` as a base.
- It then adjusts this base confidence based on the `retrodiction_score`:
    - High retrodiction (>= 0.8) boosts the weight (up to 1.0).
    - Low retrodiction (< 0.4) reduces the weight (down to 0.0).
    - Neutral or missing retrodiction scores keep the base weight.
- The output is a dictionary mapping `trace_id` of forecasts to their new adjusted trust `weight`.
- It includes a plugin system (`TRUST_UPDATE_PLUGINS`) to allow other components to react to these weight updates.
- It also provides a utility to get recent forecasts from a `pfpa_memory` instance (though `update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction` directly uses the global `PFPA_ARCHIVE`).

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness
- The core logic in `update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction()` appears complete and functional for its defined task.
- It handles cases where `retrodiction_score` might be missing or where `confidence` or `retrodiction_score` might be non-float types (with basic error handling).
- The plugin registration and execution mechanism is in place.
- An inline unit test (`_test_update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction`) is provided, which is good for verifying the core logic.
- The module includes basic logging.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps
- **Signs of intended extension:**
    - The `TRUST_UPDATE_PLUGINS` system ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:20`](trust_system/trust_update.py:20)) clearly indicates an intention for other modules or components to hook into the trust update process.
    - The adjustment logic (+0.2, -0.3) is simple; more sophisticated or configurable adjustment mechanisms could be developed.
- **Implied but missing features/modules:**
    - The actual `PFPA_ARCHIVE` is imported from `forecast_output.pfpa_logger`. The population and management of this archive happen outside this module.
    - How these updated `weights` are consumed by other parts of the system (e.g., in future trust scoring or memory management) is not detailed here.
    - No actual plugin implementations are provided within this file.
- **Indications of deviated/stopped development:**
    - The `pfpa_memory = ForecastMemory()` instance ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:18`](trust_system/trust_update.py:18)) and `get_pfpa_archive()` function ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:39`](trust_system/trust_update.py:39)) seem somewhat disconnected from `update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction()` which directly uses the global `PFPA_ARCHIVE` ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:52`](trust_system/trust_update.py:52)). This might suggest an earlier design or a parallel mechanism for accessing forecast memory. It's a minor inconsistency.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies
- **Direct imports from other project modules:**
    - `from forecast_output.pfpa_logger import PFPA_ARCHIVE` ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:10`](trust_system/trust_update.py:10)): This is a critical dependency for the source of forecasts to be updated.
    - `from analytics.forecast_memory import ForecastMemory` ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:11`](trust_system/trust_update.py:11)): Used to instantiate `pfpa_memory`, though this instance isn't directly used by the main weight update function.
- **External library dependencies:**
    - `typing.Dict`, `List`, `Callable` ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:12`](trust_system/trust_update.py:12)) (Python standard library)
    - `logging` ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:13`](trust_system/trust_update.py:13)) (Python standard library)
- **Interaction with other modules:**
    - Primarily interacts with `forecast_output.pfpa_logger` to get data.
    - The updated `weights` are intended to be consumed by other parts of the trust system or memory management components.
    - Plugins registered via `register_trust_update_plugin` would be called, creating further interactions.
- **Input/output files:**
    - Does not directly read from or write to files, but relies on `PFPA_ARCHIVE` which is presumably populated from persisted data or in-memory logs.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages
- **`update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction()`:**
  ```python
  # Assuming PFPA_ARCHIVE is populated elsewhere
  # from trust_system.trust_update import update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction, PFPA_ARCHIVE

  # Example: Manually populate PFPA_ARCHIVE for demonstration
  # In a real scenario, pfpa_logger would handle this.
  # PFPA_ARCHIVE.clear() # Clear previous state if any
  # PFPA_ARCHIVE.append({\"trace_id\": \"fc_A\", \"confidence\": 0.8, \"retrodiction_score\": 0.9})
  # PFPA_ARCHIVE.append({\"trace_id\": \"fc_B\", \"confidence\": 0.6, \"retrodiction_score\": 0.2})
  # PFPA_ARCHIVE.append({\"trace_id\": \"fc_C\", \"confidence\": 0.7}) # No retrodiction score

  # updated_weights = update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction()
  # for trace_id, weight in updated_weights.items():
  #     print(f"Forecast {trace_id} updated trust weight: {weight:.2f}")
  ```
- **Plugin Usage:**
  ```python
  # from trust_system.trust_update import register_trust_update_plugin, update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction, PFPA_ARCHIVE
  # from typing import Dict

  # def my_custom_weight_logger(weights: Dict[str, float]):
  #     print("My custom plugin received updated weights:")
  #     for tid, w in weights.items():
  #         print(f"  Plugin Log - {tid}: {w}")

  # register_trust_update_plugin(my_custom_weight_logger)

  # PFPA_ARCHIVE.append({\"trace_id\": \"fc_D\", \"confidence\": 0.5, \"retrodiction_score\": 0.85})
  # update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction() # This will trigger the plugin
  ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues
- **Retrodiction Score Thresholds:** The thresholds `0.8` and `0.4` ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:68`](trust_system/trust_update.py:68), [`trust_system/trust_update.py:71`](trust_system/trust_update.py:71)) for categorizing retrodiction scores are hardcoded.
- **Weight Adjustment Values:** The amounts by which weights are adjusted (`+ 0.2`, `- 0.3`) ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:69`](trust_system/trust_update.py:69), [`trust_system/trust_update.py:72`](trust_system/trust_update.py:72)) are hardcoded.
- **Default Confidence:** If `confidence` cannot be converted to float, it defaults to `0.5` ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:56-58`](trust_system/trust_update.py:56-58)).
- **PFPA Memory Lookback:** `get_pfpa_archive()` returns the most recent `100` forecasts ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:41`](trust_system/trust_update.py:41)). This limit is hardcoded. However, the main update function uses the global `PFPA_ARCHIVE` directly, which might not be limited in the same way by this function.

## 7. Coupling Points
- **Global Variable Dependency:** The core function `update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction` directly depends on the global `PFPA_ARCHIVE` imported from `forecast_output.pfpa_logger`. This makes it harder to test in isolation without manipulating this global state (as done in the inline `_test_update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction` function).
- **Data Structure Dependency:** Relies on forecasts in `PFPA_ARCHIVE` being dictionaries with specific keys (`\"trace_id\"`, `\"confidence\"`, `\"retrodiction_score\"`).
- **`ForecastMemory` Instance:** The module-level `pfpa_memory` instance of `ForecastMemory` is created but not directly used by the primary weight update logic, creating a slight conceptual disconnect.

## 8. Existing Tests
- An inline unit test function `_test_update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction()` ([`trust_system/trust_update.py:93`](trust_system/trust_update.py:93)) exists within the module. This test manipulates the global `PFPA_ARCHIVE` to check different scenarios.
- While this inline test is good for basic validation, a separate test file (e.g., `tests/test_trust_update.py`) using proper mocking or test fixtures for `PFPA_ARCHIVE` would be more robust and align better with common testing practices. A search for such a file yielded no results.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow
- **Global State:** Initializes a logger and a `pfpa_memory` instance. `TRUST_UPDATE_PLUGINS` is a global list.
- **Plugin System:**
    - `register_trust_update_plugin(plugin_fn)`: Appends a callable to `TRUST_UPDATE_PLUGINS`.
    - `run_trust_update_plugins(weights)`: Iterates through registered plugins and calls them with the updated weights, with basic error handling.
- **Core Logic (`update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction()`):**
    1. Initializes empty `weights` and `explanations` dictionaries.
    2. Iterates through each `forecast` in the global `PFPA_ARCHIVE`.
    3. Extracts `trace_id`, `confidence` (base weight), and `retrodiction_score`. Includes error handling for type conversion of `confidence` and `retrodiction_score`.
    4. Applies adjustment logic:
        - If `retrodiction_score` is `None`, weight is `base`.
        - If `retrodiction_score >= 0.8`, weight is `min(1.0, base + 0.2)`.
        - If `retrodiction_score < 0.4`, weight is `max(0.0, base - 0.3)`.
        - Otherwise (0.4 <= retrodiction_score < 0.8), weight is `base`.
    5. Stores the calculated weight and an explanation string.
    6. Logs the number of updated weights and debug information for each.
    7. Calls `run_trust_update_plugins(weights)`.
    8. Returns the `weights` dictionary.
- **Utility/Helper Functions:**
    - `get_pfpa_archive()`: Retrieves recent forecasts from the `pfpa_memory` instance (not directly used by the main update logic).
    - `simulate_weight_report()`: Calls the update function and prints a summary.
- **Testing:**
    - `_test_update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction()`: An inline test function.
- **Main Block (`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`)**: Runs `simulate_weight_report()` and the inline test when the script is executed directly.

## 10. Naming Conventions
- **Functions/Methods:** snake_case (e.g., `update_trust_weights_from_retrodiction`, `register_trust_update_plugin`) - Standard. `_test_` prefix for the internal test function is a common convention.
- **Variables:** snake_case (e.g., `weights`, `retro_score`, `tid`) - Standard.
- **Constants/Globals:** `PFPA_ARCHIVE`, `TRUST_UPDATE_PLUGINS` (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE) - Standard. `pfpa_memory` is module-level but not strictly constant, so snake_case is acceptable.
- Naming is generally clear and follows Python conventions.
