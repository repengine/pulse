# Module Analysis: dev_tools/compress_forecast_chain.py

## Module Intent/Purpose
The primary role of this module is to provide a command-line interface (CLI) tool for compressing a forecast mutation chain into a single, canonical forecast. This compression is based on factors like alignment, trust, and arc stability, as indicated by the module's docstring.

## Operational Status/Completeness
The module appears to be a functional CLI script for its stated purpose. The provided code snippet does not contain obvious placeholders or TODO comments, suggesting it is complete for its current scope.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps
Based on the code alone, it is difficult to identify specific implementation gaps or intended but unfinished next steps within this module itself. Its functionality relies heavily on imported modules, so any gaps would likely reside within those dependencies.

## Connections & Dependencies
*   **Direct imports from other project modules:**
    *   [`forecast_output.mutation_compression_engine`](forecast_output/mutation_compression_engine.py)
    *   [`analytics.forecast_episode_tracer`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py)
*   **External library dependencies:**
    *   `argparse`
    *   `json`
*   **Interaction with other modules:** The module interacts with `mutation_compression_engine` for the core compression logic and `forecast_episode_tracer` to build the episode chain from input data. It reads forecast data from a `.jsonl` file and writes the compressed output to a file.
*   **Input/output files:**
    *   Input: Forecast archive in `.jsonl` format (specified via `--batch` argument).
    *   Output: Compressed forecast file (path specified via `--export` argument).

## Function and Class Example Usages
*   [`load_jsonl(path)`](dev_tools/compress_forecast_chain.py:19): A utility function to read a newline-delimited JSON file and return a list of parsed JSON objects.
*   [`main()`](dev_tools/compress_forecast_chain.py:23): The main entry point for the CLI tool. It parses command-line arguments (`--batch`, `--root`, `--export`), loads forecast data, builds the episode chain using `build_episode_chain`, compresses the chain using `compress_episode_chain`, and exports the result using `export_compressed_episode`.

```python
# Example CLI Usage:
# python dev_tools/compress_forecast_chain.py --batch /path/to/forecast_archive.jsonl --root <root_trace_id> --export /path/to/compressed_forecast.json
```

## Hardcoding Issues
No obvious hardcoded variables, symbols, secrets, paths, magic numbers/strings were identified in the provided code snippet.

## Coupling Points
The module is coupled with the `mutation_compression_engine` and `forecast_episode_tracer` modules, relying on their functions for core operations.

## Existing Tests
Based on the `list_files` result for the `tests/dev_tools/` directory, there is no dedicated test file for `dev_tools/compress_forecast_chain.py`. This indicates a lack of specific tests for this module's functionality.

## Module Architecture and Flow
The module follows a simple procedural architecture typical for a CLI script:
1.  Parse command-line arguments.
2.  Load input data from a specified `.jsonl` file.
3.  Build a forecast episode chain using a root trace ID.
4.  Compress the built chain using an external engine.
5.  Export the compressed forecast to a specified output file.

## Naming Conventions
The naming conventions used in the module (e.g., `load_jsonl`, `main`, `args`, `forecasts`, `chain`, `compressed`, `export`) appear consistent with standard Python practices (PEP 8) using `snake_case` for functions and variables.
