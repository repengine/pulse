# Module Analysis: `learning/trace_forecast_episode.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

This module serves as a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool. Its primary role is to trace the lineage of forecast episodes from a given batch of forecast data. It reconstructs the chain of forecast versions starting from a specified root `TRACE_ID` and provides a summary of the "drift" or changes across this lineage, particularly focusing on symbolic tags and arc labels.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be a complete and functional utility for its defined scope.
- It includes argument parsing for necessary inputs (`--batch` file and `--root` ID).
- It handles file loading ([`load_jsonl()`](learning/trace_forecast_episode.py:12)).
- It utilizes imported functions for core logic ([`build_episode_chain()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1) and [`summarize_lineage_drift()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1)).
- It prints a formatted summary of the results to standard output.
- There are no apparent TODO comments or placeholder code sections.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Limited Scope:** The module is highly specific. While complete for its current function, it doesn't show signs of partially implemented broader features.
- **Potential Enhancements (not necessarily gaps):**
    - More sophisticated drift analysis (e.g., statistical measures, detailed diffs beyond symbolic tags).
    - Output options beyond console printing (e.g., to a file, structured JSON output for machine consumption).
    - Visualization of the forecast episode chain.
- **No Obvious Deviations:** There are no clear indications that development started on a more extensive path and was then cut short.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Project Module Imports:
- `from analytics.forecast_episode_tracer import build_episode_chain, summarize_lineage_drift`:
    - [`build_episode_chain()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1): Likely reconstructs the sequence of related forecasts.
    - [`summarize_lineage_drift()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1): Likely analyzes and summarizes changes across the forecast chain.
    (Both imported from [`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py))

### External Library Dependencies:
- `argparse`: Standard Python library for parsing command-line arguments.
- `json`: Standard Python library for working with JSON data.

### Interaction via Shared Data:
- **Input File:** The module reads a JSONL (JSON Lines) file specified by the `--batch` command-line argument. This file is expected to contain an archive of forecast objects, presumably generated by other parts of the Pulse system. Each line in the file is a separate JSON object representing a forecast.

### Input/Output Files:
- **Input:**
    - A `.jsonl` file (e.g., `path.jsonl` as per usage instructions) containing forecast data.
- **Output:**
    - All output is directed to standard output (the console).
    - It prints the episode chain, showing `trace_id`, `arc_label`, and `symbolic_tag` for each version.
    - It prints a summary of symbolic drift.
    - No files are created or modified by this script.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

### Functions:

- **[`load_jsonl(path)`](learning/trace_forecast_episode.py:12):**
    - **Description:** Opens a file at the given `path`, reads it line by line, parses each non-empty line as a JSON object, and returns a list of these objects.
    - **Example Usage (conceptual):**
      ```python
      # forecasts = load_jsonl("archive/forecast_data.jsonl")
      ```

- **[`main()`](learning/trace_forecast_episode.py:16):**
    - **Description:** The main entry point of the script. It sets up command-line argument parsing, retrieves the arguments, loads the forecast data using [`load_jsonl()`](learning/trace_forecast_episode.py:12), processes the data using [`build_episode_chain()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1) and [`summarize_lineage_drift()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1), and then prints the results.
    - **CLI Usage (as per docstring):**
      ```bash
      python tools/trace_forecast_episode.py --batch path.jsonl --root TRACE_ID
      ```
      (Note: The docstring mentions `tools/trace_forecast_episode.py`, but the file itself is in `learning/`)

### Classes:
- No classes are defined within this module.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

- **File Path in Docstring:** The usage instruction in the module's docstring (`python tools/trace_forecast_episode.py ...`) refers to the script being in a `tools/` directory. However, the script is located at `learning/trace_forecast_episode.py`. This is a minor documentation inconsistency rather than a functional hardcoding issue.
- **No other significant hardcoded paths, secrets, or magic numbers** were identified that would impede typical operation or require frequent changes. Input data path and root ID are parameterized.

## 7. Coupling Points

- **Data Structure:** Tightly coupled to the expected JSON structure of forecast objects within the input `.jsonl` file. Changes to the forecast object schema (e.g., field names like `trace_id`, `arc_label`, `symbolic_tag`) would likely break this script or the underlying `analytics.forecast_episode_tracer` functions.
- **`analytics.forecast_episode_tracer` Module:** Highly dependent on the imported functions [`build_episode_chain()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1) and [`summarize_lineage_drift()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1) from the [`analytics.forecast_episode_tracer`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py) module. Any changes to the API or behavior of these functions would directly impact this script.

## 8. Existing Tests

- No corresponding test file (e.g., `tests/learning/test_trace_forecast_episode.py` or `tests/test_trace_forecast_episode.py`) is immediately apparent from the provided file listing.
- The core logic is delegated to [`memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py), which may or may not have its own dedicated tests. A file named [`tests/memory/test_forecast_episode_tracer.py`](tests/memory/test_forecast_episode_tracer.py) would be the expected location for such tests, but its presence is not confirmed from the current context.
- **Assessment:** Without visibility into tests for `analytics.forecast_episode_tracer`, the test coverage for the functionality used by this CLI tool is unknown.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module follows a simple linear flow typical for a CLI script:
1.  **Argument Parsing:** The [`main()`](learning/trace_forecast_episode.py:16) function initializes `argparse` to define and parse two required command-line arguments: `--batch` (path to the JSONL forecast archive) and `--root` (the `TRACE_ID` to start tracing from).
2.  **Data Loading:** The `args.batch` path is passed to [`load_jsonl()`](learning/trace_forecast_episode.py:12), which reads the JSONL file and returns a list of forecast dictionaries.
3.  **Episode Chain Construction:** The loaded `forecasts` and `args.root` ID are passed to [`build_episode_chain()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1) (from [`analytics.forecast_episode_tracer`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py)). This function presumably filters and orders the forecasts to create a chronological chain representing the episode's lineage.
4.  **Drift Summarization:** The resulting `chain` is passed to [`summarize_lineage_drift()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1) (from [`analytics.forecast_episode_tracer`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py)). This function analyzes the chain to identify and quantify changes or "drift" in symbolic tags or other relevant attributes.
5.  **Output Generation:**
    - The script prints a header and then iterates through the `chain`, printing the index, `trace_id`, `arc_label`, and `symbolic_tag` for each forecast in the episode.
    - It then prints another header and iterates through the `summary` dictionary (output of [`summarize_lineage_drift()`](memory/forecast_episode_tracer.py:1)), printing key-value pairs of the drift summary.
6.  **Execution Guard:** The script uses the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard to ensure [`main()`](learning/trace_forecast_episode.py:16) is called only when the script is executed directly.

## 10. Naming Conventions

- **Functions:** [`load_jsonl()`](learning/trace_forecast_episode.py:12), [`main()`](learning/trace_forecast_episode.py:16) use `snake_case`, which is consistent with PEP 8.
- **Variables:** `parser`, `args`, `forecasts`, `chain`, `summary`, `fc`, `k`, `v` also use `snake_case` or are conventional short iterators.
- **Module Name:** [`trace_forecast_episode.py`](learning/trace_forecast_episode.py) uses `snake_case`.
- **Constants:** No module-level constants are defined.
- **Overall:** Naming conventions appear consistent with PEP 8. No obvious AI assumption errors in naming were noted. The names are generally descriptive of their purpose.
