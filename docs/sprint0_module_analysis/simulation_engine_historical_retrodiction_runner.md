# SPARC Analysis: simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py

**File Path:** [`simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:1)

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose (Specification)

The primary purpose of the [`historical_retrodiction_runner.py`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:1) module is to serve as a **compatibility layer**. Its original functionality, related to loading historical data for "retrodiction" (predicting past events), has been deprecated and merged into [`simulation_engine/simulator_core.py`](simulation_engine/simulator_core.py:1). This module exists solely to maintain backward compatibility, likely for existing tests or older parts of the system that still reference its interface.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module is **complete** for its stated purpose as a compatibility layer. It provides the previously available interfaces:
*   A function [`get_default_variable_state()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:17)
*   A class [`RetrodictionLoader`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:39)

There are no obvious placeholders or TODOs within this module related to its compatibility function.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

Given its role as a deprecated compatibility layer, there are no implementation gaps or unfinished next steps *for this module*. The "next step" was its deprecation and merge into [`simulation_engine/simulator_core.py`](simulation_engine/simulator_core.py:1). Future work would involve refactoring any remaining consumers to use [`simulation_engine/simulator_core.py`](simulation_engine/simulator_core.py:1) directly and then removing this compatibility module.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports (Standard Libraries):**
    *   [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html): Used for accessing environment variables ([`os.environ.get()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:15)).
    *   [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html): Used for loading data from a JSON file ([`json.load()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:29), [`json.load()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:50)).
    *   `typing.Dict`, `typing.Any`, `typing.Optional`: Used for type hinting.
    *   `pathlib.Path`: Used for path manipulation and checking file existence ([`Path()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:26), [`path.exists()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:27)).
*   **Direct Imports (Other Project Modules):**
    *   None.
*   **Touched Project Files (for dependency mapping):**
    *   [`simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:1) (the module itself)
*   **Interactions (Shared Data, Files, DBs, Queues):**
    *   The module interacts with the file system by reading a JSON file. The path to this file is determined by the `PULSE_TRUTH_PATH` environment variable or defaults to `'data/historical_variables.json'` (see Hardcoding Issues).
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** A JSON file (e.g., [`data/historical_variables.json`](data/historical_variables.json:0)) containing historical variable states and snapshots. The expected structure for `get_default_variable_state` is a dictionary, potentially with a top-level "variables" key. For `RetrodictionLoader`, it expects a dictionary, potentially with a "snapshots" key.
    *   **Output:** The module's functions and class methods return Python dictionaries parsed from the input JSON file.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

**Function: `get_default_variable_state()`**
```python
# Assuming 'data/historical_variables.json' contains:
# {
#   "variables": {
#     "temperature": 25.5,
#     "humidity": 60.0
#   }
# }
# OR
# {
#   "energy_cost": 1.5
# }

from engine.historical_retrodiction_runner import get_default_variable_state

default_state = get_default_variable_state()
# default_state might be {'temperature': 25.5, 'humidity': 60.0}
# or {'energy_cost': 1.5}
# or {'energy_cost': 1.0} if file not found or error occurs
print(default_state)
```

**Class: `RetrodictionLoader`**
```python
# Assuming 'data/historical_variables.json' (or path from PULSE_TRUTH_PATH) contains:
# {
#   "snapshots": {
#     "0": {"var_a": 10, "var_b": 20},
#     "1": {"var_a": 12, "var_b": 22}
#   }
# }

from engine.historical_retrodiction_runner import RetrodictionLoader

loader = RetrodictionLoader() # Uses default path or PULSE_TRUTH_PATH
# loader = RetrodictionLoader(path="custom/path/to/data.json") # Uses custom path

snapshot_turn_0 = loader.get_snapshot_by_turn(0)
# snapshot_turn_0 would be {'var_a': 10, 'var_b': 20}

snapshot_turn_5 = loader.get_snapshot_by_turn(5)
# snapshot_turn_5 would be None if turn "5" is not in snapshots
print(snapshot_turn_0)
print(snapshot_turn_5)
```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues (SPARC Critical)

*   **File Path:** The constant [`TRUTH_PATH`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:15) defaults to the hardcoded string `'data/historical_variables.json'`.
    *   **Mitigation:** This is partially mitigated by allowing an override via the `PULSE_TRUTH_PATH` environment variable: `os.environ.get('PULSE_TRUTH_PATH', 'data/historical_variables.json')`.
    *   **SPARC Concern:** While an environment variable provides flexibility, relying on a default hardcoded path within the codebase can still be problematic if the environment variable is not set or if the project structure changes. For a deprecated module, this might be acceptable, but in active code, such paths should ideally be managed through a more robust configuration system.
*   **Default Fallback Value:** In [`get_default_variable_state()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:37), if the file cannot be read or parsed correctly, it returns a hardcoded default: `{"energy_cost": 1.0}`. This behavior might mask issues with the data file or its path.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **File Structure:** The module is tightly coupled to the expected JSON structure of the file located at `TRUTH_PATH`.
    *   [`get_default_variable_state()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:17) expects either a flat dictionary or a dictionary with a `'variables'` key.
    *   [`RetrodictionLoader`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:39) expects a dictionary with a `'snapshots'` key, where snapshots are keyed by string representations of turn numbers.
    Any deviation from this structure will lead to errors or incorrect data loading (though it has basic `try-except Exception` blocks).
*   **Environment Variable:** The module's behavior is coupled to the `PULSE_TRUTH_PATH` environment variable.

## 8. Existing Tests (SPARC Refinement)

The module's docstring explicitly states: "This file exists to maintain backward compatibility with existing tests." ([`simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:5-6`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:5)). This implies that tests for this module's interface exist.
Based on the project structure (from `environment_details`), a likely location for these tests is [`tests/test_historical_retrodiction_runner.py`](tests/test_historical_retrodiction_runner.py:0).
A full assessment of test coverage and quality would require inspecting this test file. However, the module's existence for test compatibility is a good sign from a SPARC refinement perspective, as it indicates an effort to avoid breaking existing test suites during refactoring.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow (SPARC Architecture)

The architecture is very simple, as expected for a compatibility layer:
*   A module-level constant [`TRUTH_PATH`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:15) defines the data source.
*   A standalone function [`get_default_variable_state()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:17) attempts to load and return a dictionary of variables from the `TRUTH_PATH` file. It includes error handling and a fallback default.
*   A class [`RetrodictionLoader`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:39):
    *   The [`__init__()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:44) method initializes the path to the data file and attempts to load 'snapshots' data from it into an instance variable `self.snapshots`. It includes basic error handling.
    *   The [`get_snapshot_by_turn()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:55) method retrieves a specific snapshot by turn number (as a string key) from the loaded `self.snapshots`.

The flow is straightforward: initialize (for the class) or call (for the function), attempt to read and parse a JSON file, and return the data or a default/None.

## 10. Naming Conventions (SPARC Maintainability)

*   **Constants:** [`TRUTH_PATH`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:15) is in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, which is standard for Python constants.
*   **Functions:** [`get_default_variable_state()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:17) is in `snake_case`, standard for Python functions.
*   **Classes:** [`RetrodictionLoader`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:39) is in `PascalCase`, standard for Python classes.
*   **Methods:** [`__init__()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:44), [`get_snapshot_by_turn()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:55) are in `snake_case`, standard for Python methods.
*   **Variables:** `path`, `data`, `f`, `snapshots`, `turn` are generally clear and follow `snake_case`.

The naming conventions are consistent with Python best practices (PEP 8) and contribute positively to maintainability. The names are descriptive of their purpose.

## 11. SPARC Compliance Summary

*   **Specification:** The module's purpose as a compatibility layer is clearly stated in its docstring.
*   **Modularity/Architecture:**
    *   The module is small and focused on its compatibility task.
    *   It's explicitly noted that its core logic now resides in [`simulation_engine/simulator_core.py`](simulation_engine/simulator_core.py:1), indicating a shift towards better modularity in the main codebase.
*   **Refinement Focus:**
    *   **Testability:** The module's existence is justified by the need to support existing tests, which is a positive sign for maintaining test coverage during refactoring.
    *   **Security (Hardcoding):**
        *   The default file path `'data/historical_variables.json'` is hardcoded but can be overridden by an environment variable `PULSE_TRUTH_PATH`. This is a partial mitigation.
        *   A default fallback dictionary `{"energy_cost": 1.0}` is hardcoded in [`get_default_variable_state()`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:37).
        *   No other hardcoded secrets, API keys, or obviously sensitive data are present.
    *   **Maintainability:**
        *   Naming conventions are good and follow PEP 8.
        *   Code clarity is reasonable for its simple functions.
        *   Docstrings are present for the module, function, and class, explaining their (compatibility) purpose.
*   **No Hardcoding (Strict):** Fails slightly due to the default path and fallback dictionary, though the path has an override mechanism.

**Overall SPARC Assessment:**
For a deprecated compatibility module, [`historical_retrodiction_runner.py`](simulation_engine/historical_retrodiction_runner.py:1) is reasonably SPARC-compliant. Its main purpose (maintaining test compatibility) aligns with refinement principles. The primary concern is the hardcoded default path, though the environment variable override lessens the impact. The module is simple, and its role is well-defined. The ideal long-term SPARC-aligned action would be to refactor consumers to remove dependency on this module, allowing its eventual deletion.
