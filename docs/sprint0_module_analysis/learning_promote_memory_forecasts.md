# SPARC Analysis: `learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py`

**File Path:** [`learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:1)

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose (Specification)

The primary role of this module is to serve as a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for promoting selected forecasts into a "core forecast memory." It achieves this by:
1.  Accepting a batch of forecasts from a JSONL file.
2.  Utilizing functions from the `analytics.forecast_memory_promoter` module to select which forecasts are "promotable."
3.  Exporting these selected forecasts to another JSONL file, which represents the core forecast memory.

The module is designed to be invoked from the command line, as indicated by its usage instructions and reliance on the `argparse` library.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The script appears to be operationally complete for its defined, limited scope. It successfully parses arguments, loads data using the [`load_jsonl`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:11) function, and then calls external functions ([`select_promotable_forecasts`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:9) and [`export_promoted`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:9)) to perform the core logic. There are no explicit `TODO` comments or obvious placeholder code within this specific file.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

While functional for its basic purpose, several areas could be considered gaps or next steps for enhancement:

*   **Error Handling:** The script has minimal error handling. For instance:
    *   [`load_jsonl`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:11) does not handle potential `FileNotFoundError` if the input batch file doesn't exist, or `json.JSONDecodeError` if the file content is not valid JSONL.
    *   Errors during the `select_promotable_forecasts` or `export_promoted` calls are not explicitly caught or managed.
*   **Logging:** No logging mechanism is implemented. For a CLI tool, especially one processing batches of data, logging successful operations, warnings, or errors would be beneficial for diagnostics and monitoring.
*   **Input Validation:** There's no validation of the structure or content of the forecasts within the input JSONL file. The script assumes the data conforms to the expectations of [`select_promotable_forecasts`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:9).
*   **Configuration Management:** The default export path is hardcoded (see Hardcoding Issues). A more robust solution might involve a centralized configuration system for such paths.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports:**
    *   `argparse`: Standard Python library for parsing command-line arguments.
    *   `json`: Standard Python library for JSON manipulation.
    *   From [`analytics.forecast_memory_promoter`](memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:1) (project module):
        *   [`select_promotable_forecasts`](memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:1)
        *   [`export_promoted`](memory/forecast_memory_promoter.py:1)
*   **Interactions:**
    *   **File System:**
        *   Reads from a JSONL file specified by the `--batch` command-line argument (e.g., `forecasts.jsonl`).
        *   Writes to a JSONL file specified by the `--export` command-line argument (defaults to `memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl`).
    *   **Module Interaction:** Delegates the core logic of selecting and exporting forecasts to the imported functions from `analytics.forecast_memory_promoter`.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** A JSONL file containing a list of forecast objects, path provided via `--batch` argument.
    *   **Output:** A JSONL file containing the promoted forecast objects, path provided via `--export` argument.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

*   **[`load_jsonl(path)`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:11):**
    *   **Description:** This function takes a file `path` (string) as input, opens the file in read mode, and iterates through each line. It strips whitespace from each line and, if the line is not empty, attempts to parse it as a JSON object. It returns a list of these parsed JSON objects (dictionaries).
    *   **Example Usage (conceptual):**
        ```python
        # Assuming 'forecast_data.jsonl' contains:
        # {"id": 1, "value": 100}
        # {"id": 2, "value": 150}
        forecast_list = load_jsonl("forecast_data.jsonl")
        # forecast_list would be:
        # [{'id': 1, 'value': 100}, {'id': 2, 'value': 150}]
        ```
*   **CLI Script Execution:**
    *   The module itself is executed as a script.
    *   **Usage Example (from docstring):**
        ```bash
        python tools/promote_memory_forecasts.py --batch forecasts.jsonl
        ```
        This command would load forecasts from `forecasts.jsonl`, select promotable ones, and export them to the default location `memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl`.
    *   **Usage with custom export:**
        ```bash
        python tools/promote_memory_forecasts.py --batch input_forecasts.jsonl --export custom_memory.jsonl
        ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues (SPARC Critical)

*   **Default Export File Path:** The default path for the exported promoted forecasts is hardcoded within the `argparse` definition:
    *   [`parser.add_argument("--export", default="memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl")`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:17)
    While this path can be overridden via the `--export` CLI argument, having a hardcoded default path can lead to issues if the project's directory structure changes or if this default is implicitly relied upon elsewhere. It violates the SPARC principle of avoiding hardcoding, especially for file paths that might change or differ across environments.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **High Coupling with `analytics.forecast_memory_promoter`:** The module is tightly coupled to the [`select_promotable_forecasts`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:9) and [`export_promoted`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:9) functions from the `analytics.forecast_memory_promoter` module. This script essentially acts as a CLI frontend for these functions. Any changes to the signature or behavior of these imported functions would directly impact this script.
*   **Data Format Coupling (JSONL):** The script is coupled to the JSONL format for both input and output files. Changes to this format would require modifications to [`load_jsonl`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:11) and potentially the `export_promoted` function (though the latter is external).
*   **File System Coupling:** Relies on direct file system operations for reading input and writing output.

## 8. Existing Tests (SPARC Refinement)

*   There are no unit tests or integration tests present *within this file*.
*   **Testability Assessment:**
    *   The [`load_jsonl`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:11) function is testable in isolation by providing mock file contents.
    *   The main script logic (argument parsing and orchestration) is best tested via integration tests that execute the script as a subprocess with various command-line arguments and mock input files, then verify the output files or the calls made to the mocked `analytics.forecast_memory_promoter` functions.
*   **Gaps:** The lack of dedicated tests for this CLI script is a gap. The reliability heavily depends on the correctness and testing of the external `analytics.forecast_memory_promoter` module.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow (SPARC Architecture)

The module follows a simple, linear execution flow typical of a CLI script:

1.  **Initialization:** Imports necessary libraries (`argparse`, `json`) and specific functions from `analytics.forecast_memory_promoter`.
2.  **Argument Parsing:** An `ArgumentParser` instance is created and configured to accept:
    *   `--batch` (required): Path to the input JSONL file.
    *   `--export` (optional, with default): Path for the output JSONL file.
    The script then parses the command-line arguments provided at runtime.
3.  **Data Loading:** The [`load_jsonl`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:11) function is called with the path from the `--batch` argument to load the forecast data into memory.
4.  **Processing (Delegation):**
    *   The loaded `batch` is passed to [`select_promotable_forecasts`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:21) (imported function) to determine which forecasts should be promoted.
5.  **Exporting (Delegation):**
    *   The `selected` forecasts and the export path (from `--export` argument) are passed to [`export_promoted`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:22) (imported function) to write the results to the output file.

This architecture is that of a thin wrapper or orchestrator, delegating the complex business logic to another, more specialized module (`analytics.forecast_memory_promoter`). This promotes modularity by separating CLI handling from the core forecast promotion logic.

## 10. Naming Conventions (SPARC Maintainability)

*   **Module Name:** [`promote_memory_forecasts.py`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:1) is descriptive of its function.
*   **Function Names:** [`load_jsonl`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:11) clearly indicates its purpose.
*   **Variable Names:** Variables like `parser`, `args`, `batch`, `selected` are concise and conventional for their roles.
*   **Argument Names:** CLI arguments `--batch` and `--export` are clear.
*   **PEP 8 Compliance:** The code generally adheres to PEP 8 naming conventions (e.g., snake_case for functions and variables).
*   **Docstrings:** The module has a docstring explaining its purpose and providing usage instructions. The [`load_jsonl`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:11) function, however, lacks a docstring.

Overall, naming conventions are good and contribute positively to maintainability.

## 11. SPARC Compliance Summary

*   **Specification:**
    *   **Adherence:** Good. The module's purpose as a CLI tool for promoting forecasts is clearly stated in the initial docstring and reflected in its implementation.
*   **Modularity/Architecture:**
    *   **Adherence:** Fair. The module effectively delegates core logic to `analytics.forecast_memory_promoter`, which is good for modularity.
    *   **Areas for Improvement:** Direct file I/O and the hardcoded default export path reduce flexibility. Using a configuration system or dependency injection for file paths and I/O operations could improve this.
*   **Refinement:**
    *   **Testability:**
        *   **Adherence:** Poor. No tests are present within the module itself. Its testability relies on external integration tests or thorough testing of the `analytics.forecast_memory_promoter` module.
        *   **Areas for Improvement:** Add unit tests for [`load_jsonl`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:11) and integration tests for the CLI functionality.
    *   **Security (No Hardcoded Secrets):**
        *   **Adherence:** Good. No secrets, API keys, or highly sensitive data are handled or hardcoded directly in this module. The main security consideration is file system access, which is typical for such a tool.
    *   **Maintainability:**
        *   **Adherence:** Good. The code is short, uses clear naming, and follows Python conventions. The delegation of complex logic aids maintainability.
        *   **Areas for Improvement:** Adding comprehensive error handling, logging, and docstrings for all functions (e.g., for [`load_jsonl`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:11)) would further enhance maintainability.
*   **No Hardcoding (SPARC Critical):**
    *   **Adherence:** Fair. The default export path (`"memory/core_forecast_memory.jsonl"`) is hardcoded in [`parser.add_argument`](learning/promote_memory_forecasts.py:17). While configurable, this default is a form of hardcoding that could be problematic.
    *   **Areas for Improvement:** Externalize default paths through a configuration mechanism.

Overall, the module is a straightforward CLI utility. Its main SPARC weaknesses lie in the lack of dedicated tests, minimal error handling/logging, and the hardcoded default output path. It adheres well to modularity by delegating its core processing.
