# Module Analysis: `learning/transforms/rolling_features.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`learning/transforms/rolling_features.py`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:1) module is to provide functionalities for creating rolling window-based features from time-series data. Currently, it offers a single function to calculate the rolling mean of a specified column in a pandas DataFrame.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module is operational for its defined, limited scope. It contains one well-defined function, [`rolling_mean_feature()`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:9), which appears complete for calculating a rolling mean. There are no obvious placeholders (e.g., `pass` statements in incomplete functions) or "TODO" comments within the existing code.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Limited Scope:** The module docstring ("Provides rolling window feature engineering for Pulse.") suggests a broader scope than what is currently implemented. It seems intended to be a collection of various rolling window feature transformations, but only includes a rolling mean.
*   **Logical Next Steps:**
    *   Addition of other common rolling window functions such as rolling standard deviation, sum, median, min, max, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
    *   Support for different window types (e.g., expanding windows).
    *   Allowing custom aggregation functions.
*   **Potential Deviation:** Development might have started with the intention of creating a comprehensive rolling features library but stopped after implementing the most basic one.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from other project modules:** None.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Used for DataFrame manipulation and the core [`rolling().mean()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rolling.html) functionality.
    *   `typing` (specifically `Any`, `pd.Series`, `pd.DataFrame`): Used for type hinting.
*   **Interaction with other modules via shared data:** This module is likely consumed by other data processing or feature engineering modules within the `learning` pipeline, which would pass pandas DataFrames to it.
*   **Input/Output Files:** The module does not directly interact with files. It operates on in-memory pandas DataFrame objects and returns a pandas Series.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

### [`rolling_mean_feature(df: pd.DataFrame, window: int = 3, column: str = None) -> pd.Series`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:9)

Calculates the rolling mean for a specified column in a pandas DataFrame.

*   **`df`**: The input DataFrame.
*   **`window`**: The size of the rolling window (default is 3).
*   **`column`**: The name of the column to calculate the rolling mean on. If `None` (default), the first column of the DataFrame is used.
*   **Returns**: A pandas Series containing the rolling mean, named in the format `"{column}_rolling_mean_{window}"`.

**Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd
from analytics.transforms.rolling_features import rolling_mean_feature

data = {'value': [10, 12, 15, 14, 16, 18, 20]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate rolling mean with window size 3 on 'value' column
rolling_avg = rolling_mean_feature(df, window=3, column='value')
print(rolling_avg)

# Output:
# 0    10.000000
# 1    11.000000
# 2    12.333333
# 3    13.666667
# 4    15.000000
# 5    16.000000
# 6    18.000000
# Name: value_rolling_mean_3, dtype: float64

# Calculate rolling mean using the first column by default
df_multi = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1,2,3,4,5], 'B': [5,4,3,2,1]})
rolling_avg_default_col = rolling_mean_feature(df_multi, window=2)
print(rolling_avg_default_col)
# Output:
# 0    1.0
# 1    1.5
# 2    2.5
# 3    3.5
# 4    4.5
# Name: A_rolling_mean_2, dtype: float64
```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Window Size:** The `window` parameter in [`rolling_mean_feature()`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:9) defaults to `3`. While this is a common default, it might be better to require it explicitly or choose a more context-aware default if possible.
*   **Default Column Selection:** If the `column` parameter is `None`, the function defaults to using the first column of the DataFrame (`df.columns[0]`) as seen in [`rolling_features.py:15`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:15). This could lead to unexpected behavior if the DataFrame column order changes or if the first column is not the intended target.
*   **Output Series Naming Convention:** The output Series name is hardcoded to the format `f"{column}_rolling_mean_{window}"` ([`rolling_features.py:16`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:16)). While descriptive, users might want more control over the output feature name.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   The module is tightly coupled to the `pandas` library, relying on its DataFrame structure and rolling window functionalities. Changes in the `pandas` API could potentially break this module.
*   It's expected to be used within a larger data processing pipeline that handles pandas DataFrames.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   **Test File:** Tests are present in [`tests/test_rolling_features.py`](tests/test_rolling_features.py:1).
*   **Test Coverage & Nature:**
    *   The test suite uses the `unittest` framework and `pandas.testing.assert_series_equal` for verifying results.
    *   [`TestRollingFeatures.test_rolling_mean_feature_basic()`](tests/test_rolling_features.py:6) tests the basic functionality with a default window and implicit first column selection.
    *   [`TestRollingFeatures.test_rolling_mean_feature_column_arg()`](tests/test_rolling_features.py:12) tests the function when a specific column is provided.
    *   The tests cover the core logic for the implemented function.
*   **Obvious Gaps or Problematic Tests:**
    *   No tests for edge cases like:
        *   Empty DataFrame.
        *   DataFrame with `NaN` values.
        *   Window size of 1.
        *   Window size larger than the number of rows (though `min_periods=1` handles this by calculating what it can).
        *   Non-numeric data in the target column (pandas would raise an error, but testing this behavior explicitly could be useful).
    *   The current tests use `result.reset_index(drop=True)` before assertion. While this ensures the comparison is on values and not index, it might mask issues if the index was unexpectedly altered.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module is very simple:
1.  It defines a single public function: [`rolling_mean_feature()`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:9).
2.  This function takes a pandas DataFrame, a window size, and an optional column name as input.
3.  It identifies the target column (either specified or the first one by default).
4.  It applies the pandas `rolling(window=window, min_periods=1).mean()` method to this column.
5.  It renames the resulting Series to include the original column name, "rolling_mean", and the window size.
6.  It returns the new pandas Series.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Module Name:** [`rolling_features.py`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:1) is appropriate and follows Python conventions.
*   **Function Name:** [`rolling_mean_feature()`](learning/transforms/rolling_features.py:9) is descriptive and follows `snake_case`.
*   **Parameter Names:** `df`, `window`, `column` are clear and conventional.
*   **Variable Names:** `result`, `expected` in tests are standard.
*   **Output Feature Naming:** The generated feature name `f"{column}_rolling_mean_{window}"` is consistent and informative.
*   The module generally adheres to PEP 8 naming conventions. No obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations were noted.
