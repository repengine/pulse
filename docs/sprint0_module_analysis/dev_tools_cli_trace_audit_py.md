# Module Analysis: `dev_tools/cli_trace_audit.py`

## Module Intent/Purpose
The primary role of this module is to provide a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the `analytics.trace_audit_engine`. It allows users to trigger trace replay, summarization, or a full audit of all traces via command-line arguments.

## Operational Status/Completeness
The module appears functionally complete for its intended purpose as a simple CLI wrapper. Its operational status and completeness are entirely dependent on the underlying `analytics.trace_audit_engine` module.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps
There are no obvious implementation gaps within this specific CLI module. Any potential gaps or unfinished steps would reside within the `analytics.trace_audit_engine` module that this CLI interacts with.

## Connections & Dependencies
*   **Direct Imports:**
    *   [`sys`](sys) (Standard library)
    *   [`analytics.trace_audit_engine`](memory/trace_audit_engine.py)
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   `sys`
*   **Interaction with other modules:**
    *   Calls functions: [`replay_trace()`](memory/trace_audit_engine.py:?), [`summarize_trace()`](memory/trace_audit_engine.py:?), [`audit_all_traces()`](memory/trace_audit_engine.py:?) from `analytics.trace_audit_engine`.
*   **Input/Output Files:** None directly handled by this module.

## Function and Class Example Usages
The module's docstring provides the intended usage:

```bash
python -m analytics.trace_audit_engine --replay <trace_id>
python -m analytics.trace_audit_engine --summarize <trace_id>
python -m analytics.trace_audit_engine --audit-all
```

## Hardcoding Issues
No obvious hardcoded variables, symbols, secrets, paths, magic numbers/strings were identified in this module.

## Coupling Points
This module is tightly coupled to the `analytics.trace_audit_engine` module, directly importing and calling its functions.

## Existing Tests
Based on the provided file list, there does not appear to be a dedicated test file for this module (e.g., `tests/dev_tools/test_cli_trace_audit.py`).

## Module Architecture and Flow
The module has a simple architecture:
1.  Parses command-line arguments using `sys.argv`.
2.  Uses `if/elif/else` to check for specific flags (`--replay`, `--summarize`, `--audit-all`).
3.  Dispatches the corresponding function call to the imported `analytics.trace_audit_engine` module based on the provided arguments.

## Naming Conventions
The module follows standard Python naming conventions (snake_case for variables and functions) and appears consistent. No obvious AI assumption errors or deviations from PEP 8 were noted within this small module.
