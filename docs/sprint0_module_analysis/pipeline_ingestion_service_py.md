# Module Analysis: `pipeline/ingestion_service.py`

## Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`pipeline/ingestion_service.py`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:1) module is to provide a thin object-oriented wrapper around the data ingestion logic, likely originating from a script (`run_ingest.py` is mentioned in comments). This allows the ingestion functionality to be imported and used by other parts of the system (e.g., [`main.py`](main.py:5) for just-in-time data) and also to be executed as a standalone script for batch ingestion. It utilizes the [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9) to perform the actual data collection from various plugins.

## Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be relatively complete for its stated purpose as a wrapper. It initializes the [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9), autoloads plugins, and provides methods to trigger ingestion and retrieve the collected data. There are no obvious placeholders or TODO comments within the provided code.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Configuration:** The module autoloads all default IRIS ingestion plugins ([`pipeline/ingestion_service.py:16`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:16)). There's no apparent mechanism for selective plugin loading or configuration directly through this service, which might be an intended simplification or a potential area for future enhancement if more granular control is needed.
*   **Error Handling:** While the underlying [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9) might have error handling, this wrapper doesn't explicitly add or expose any specific error handling or reporting mechanisms beyond what [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9) provides.
*   **Extensibility:** The service is tightly coupled to [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9). If other scraping/ingestion mechanisms were to be introduced, this service would need modification or a more abstract base.

## Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Project Imports:**
    *   [`from ingestion.iris_scraper import IrisScraper`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:9): Imports the core scraping utility.
*   **External Library Dependencies (Standard Library):**
    *   `typing` (for `Dict`, `List`): Used for type hinting ([`pipeline/ingestion_service.py:10`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:10)).
    *   `argparse`, `sys`, `json`, `pathlib`: Used in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block for CLI functionality ([`pipeline/ingestion_service.py:31`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:31)).
*   **Interaction via Shared Data:**
    *   The module, through [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9), likely interacts with various data sources via plugins.
    *   It exports data as a JSONL file ([`pipeline/ingestion_service.py:22`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:22)), which is a form of shared data.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Output:** Exports a JSONL file containing ingested signals. The path is returned by the [`ingest_once()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:19) method.
    *   **Logs:** Logging is not explicitly managed in this module but would likely be handled by the underlying [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9) or its plugins.

## Function and Class Example Usages

### Class: `IngestionService`

**Initialization:**
```python
svc = IngestionService()
```
This creates an instance of the service and autoloads IRIS ingestion plugins.

**Ingesting Data Once:**
```python
file_path = svc.ingest_once()
print(f"Signals exported to {file_path}")
```
This method triggers a batch ingestion from all loaded plugins and exports the collected signals to a JSONL file, returning the path to this file.

**Getting Latest Signals:**
```python
latest_data = svc.latest_signals()
# latest_data will be a list of dictionaries, e.g., the last run's signal_log
if latest_data:
    print(latest_data[0]) # Print the first signal
```
This method returns the list of signal dictionaries collected during the most recent ingestion run.

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
python -m pipeline.ingestion_service --once
```
This command runs the ingestion process once and prints the path to the exported JSONL file. If run without `--once`, it ingests and prints the first 5 signals to stdout.

## Hardcoding Issues

*   The comment "auto-load all default IRIS ingestion plugins" ([`pipeline/ingestion_service.py:15`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:15)) implies that the set of "default" plugins is defined elsewhere, possibly within [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9) or its plugin manager. This isn't strictly a hardcoding issue within this file but points to a configuration defined upstream.
*   The CLI fallback behavior prints the first 5 signals ([`pipeline/ingestion_service.py:44`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:44)). The number `5` is a magic number.

## Coupling Points

*   **High Coupling with `ingestion.iris_scraper.IrisScraper`:** The [`IngestionService`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:12) is fundamentally a wrapper for [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9) and directly depends on its methods like [`plugin_manager.autoload()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:16), [`batch_ingest_from_plugins()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:21), and [`export_signal_log()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:22), as well as its `signal_log` attribute.
*   **Dependency on IRIS Plugin Ecosystem:** The functionality relies entirely on the plugins available to and loaded by [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9).

## Existing Tests

*   A specific test file named `test_ingestion_service.py` was not found in the `tests/` directory.
*   It's possible that tests for this module's functionality are integrated within tests for [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9) or within broader integration tests for the ingestion pipeline (e.g., files like [`tests/ingestion/test_incremental_ingestion.py`](tests/ingestion/test_incremental_ingestion.py) or [`tests/ingestion/test_ingestion_changes.py`](tests/ingestion/test_ingestion_changes.py) might cover some aspects).
*   Without dedicated tests for [`IngestionService`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:12), it's difficult to assess coverage for its specific wrapper logic and CLI interface.

## Module Architecture and Flow

1.  **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    *   An [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9) instance is created.
    *   Default IRIS ingestion plugins are autoloaded via the scraper's plugin manager.
2.  **Public API Methods**:
    *   [`ingest_once()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:19):
        *   Calls [`self.scraper.batch_ingest_from_plugins()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:21) to perform data collection.
        *   Calls [`self.scraper.export_signal_log()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:22) to save the data and returns the file path.
    *   [`latest_signals()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:24):
        *   Retrieves the `signal_log` attribute from the scraper instance (or an empty list if not found).
3.  **CLI Interface (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**:
    *   Parses command-line arguments (specifically `--once`).
    *   Creates an [`IngestionService`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:12) instance.
    *   If `--once` is specified:
        *   Calls [`ingest_once()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:19).
        *   Prints the output file path.
        *   Exits.
    *   Fallback (no `--once`):
        *   Calls [`ingest_once()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:19).
        *   Prints the first 5 signals from [`latest_signals()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:24) to `stdout` as JSON.

The module acts as a straightforward facade over the [`IrisScraper`](iris/iris_scraper.py:9) functionality, simplifying its use for one-off ingestion tasks or for retrieving the latest batch of signals.

## Naming Conventions

*   **Class Name:** [`IngestionService`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:12) is clear and follows PascalCase, typical for Python classes.
*   **Method Names:** [`ingest_once()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:19), [`latest_signals()`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:24) use snake_case and are descriptive.
*   **Variable Names:** `scraper`, `svc`, `args`, `out` are generally clear within their context. `p` for [`ArgumentParser`](pipeline/ingestion_service.py:32) is a common short variable name.
*   The naming conventions appear consistent and generally follow PEP 8 guidelines. No obvious AI assumption errors or significant deviations were noted in this small module.
