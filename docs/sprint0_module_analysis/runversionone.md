# Module Analysis: `runversionone.py`

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-14
**Module Path:** [`runversionone.py`](../../../runversionone.py)

## Module Intent/Purpose

The primary purpose of the [`runversionone.py`](../../../runversionone.py:1) module is to serve as an executable script to:
1.  Establish a baseline forecast accuracy by running a retrodiction simulation using historical data. This involves loading data, simulating turn-by-turn, and comparing simulated states against ground truth historical snapshots to calculate error metrics (MSE for variables, overlays, and capital).
2.  Execute an optimized, parallel retrodiction training process for a defined set of variables over a specified historical period.
3.  Compare the performance and accuracy (if applicable metrics are produced by the parallel training) of the optimized training against the established baseline.

The script is designed to demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of the parallel training infrastructure against a more traditional, sequential simulation approach for retrodiction.

## Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operationally complete for its defined two-step process: baseline establishment and parallel training execution.
- It includes functionality for loading and preparing historical data via the `HistoricalDataLoader` class.
- The baseline accuracy establishment logic seems complete, with turn-by-turn simulation and error calculation.
- It sets up and calls the parallel training coordinator.
- It attempts to log and compare results from both processes.

No explicit TODO comments or obvious placeholders for core functionality were noted within the main execution flow.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Robustness of `LearningEngine` Interaction:** The script makes assumptions about how [`LearningEngine`](../../../runversionone.py:11) and [`EnhancedRecursiveTrainingMetrics`](../../../runversionone.py:10) interact, particularly around lines [`168-178`](../../../runversionone.py:168). This interaction point might be fragile or could benefit from a more explicit interface or clarification in the involved modules.
- **Error Handling in Simulation Loop:** While some checks for missing snapshots exist (e.g., [`line 215`](../../../runversionone.py:215), [`line 281`](../../../runversionone.py:281)), error handling within the `simulate_forward` calls or for unexpected data structures could be more comprehensive.
- **Fallback for Optimized MSE:** The fallback value for `optimized_mse` on [`line 388`](../../../runversionone.py:388) (`baseline_mse * 0.9`) is arbitrary. A more meaningful handling or error logging would be better if `training_results` doesn't provide a `final_mse`.
- **Utility Function Scope:** The `compute_full_state_error` function, defined locally within [`establish_baseline_accuracy`](../../../runversionone.py:120), could potentially be a shared utility if similar error calculations are needed elsewhere.
- **WorldState Initialization from Snapshots:** The method of initializing [`WorldState`](../../../runversionone.py:7) components (e.g., [`Variables`](../../../runversionone.py:8), [`SymbolicOverlays`](../../../runversionone.py:8), [`CapitalExposure`](../../../runversionone.py:8)) from dictionary snapshots (e.g., lines [`204-206`](../../../runversionone.py:204), [`269-271`](../../../runversionone.py:269), [`305-307`](../../../runversionone.py:305)) relies on specific dictionary keys and structures. This could be brittle if the snapshot format changes.
- **Unused Import:** The import of [`optimized_bayesian_trust_tracker`](../../../runversionone.py:13) from [`core.optimized_trust_tracker`](../../../core/optimized_trust_tracker.py) is present but the function is not used within the script.

### Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data
- **[`RecursiveDataStore`](../../../runversionone.py:9):** The script reads historical datasets (e.g., `historical_spx_close`) managed by the data store. The structure and availability of this data are crucial.

### Input/Output Files
- **Input:**
    - Reads historical data via [`RecursiveDataStore`](../../../runversionone.py:9). The specific datasets are derived from the `baseline_variables` list (e.g., `historical_spx_close`).
- **Output:**
    - Prints extensive logs to the console detailing the progress and results of baseline establishment and parallel training.
    - Potentially writes a JSON file named `parallel_training_results.json` (defined in `training_config` on [`line 371`](../../../runversionone.py:371)), depending on the implementation of [`run_parallel_retrodiction_training`](../../../runversionone.py:12).

## Function and Class Example Usages

- **Class `HistoricalDataLoader` ([`runversionone.py:19`](../../../runversionone.py:19)):**
    - Purpose: Loads, organizes, and provides access to historical data snapshots by turn number.
    - Usage: `data_loader = HistoricalDataLoader(historical_data_dict)`
    - Key Methods:
        - [`__init__(self, historical_data)`](../../../runversionone.py:23)
        - [`get_snapshot_by_turn(self, turn)`](../../../runversionone.py:59)
        - [`get_total_turns(self)`](../../../runversionone.py:75)

- **[`load_historical_data_for_baseline(variable_names)`](../../../runversionone.py:79):**
    - Purpose: Fetches historical data for specified variables from [`RecursiveDataStore`](../../../runversionone.py:9).
    - Usage: `historical_data = load_historical_data_for_baseline(["spx_close", "us_10y_yield"])`

- **[`list_available_historical_datasets()`](../../../runversionone.py:108):**
    - Purpose: Lists datasets in [`RecursiveDataStore`](../../../runversionone.py:9) that start with "historical_".
    - Usage: `available_sets = list_available_historical_datasets()` (Note: This function is defined but not called in the main script execution path).

- **[`establish_baseline_accuracy(variable_names, simulation_turns)`](../../../runversionone.py:120):**
    - Purpose: Runs a retrodiction simulation to establish baseline accuracy metrics.
    - Usage: `baseline_results = establish_baseline_accuracy(baseline_variables, 100)`
    - Internal function `compute_full_state_error(simulated_state, ground_truth_state)` calculates MSE.

- **Main Execution Block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) ([`runversionone.py:332`](../../../runversionone.py:332)):**
    - Orchestrates the overall process:
        1. Defines `baseline_variables` and `baseline_simulation_turns`.
        2. Calls [`establish_baseline_accuracy()`](../../../runversionone.py:120).
        3. Sets up `training_config` including date ranges and worker counts.
        4. Calls [`run_parallel_retrodiction_training()`](../../../runversionone.py:12).
        5. Logs results and comparison.

## Hardcoding Issues

- **Variable Names for Baseline:** The list `baseline_variables` ([`line 337`](../../../runversionone.py:337)) is hardcoded.
- **Simulation Parameters:**
    - `baseline_simulation_turns` ([`line 339`](../../../runversionone.py:339)).
    - `max_workers` calculation logic ([`line 342`](../../../runversionone.py:342)), though it dynamically uses `os.cpu_count()`.
    - Training period (3 years, [`line 362`](../../../runversionone.py:362)).
    - `batch_size_days` (30 days, [`line 370`](../../../runversionone.py:370)).
- **Dataset Naming Convention:** The prefix "historical_" for dataset names is hardcoded in [`load_historical_data_for_baseline()`](../../../runversionone.py:94) and [`list_available_historical_datasets()`](../../../runversionone.py:114).
- **Output Filename:** The output file for parallel training results, `parallel_training_results.json`, is hardcoded in `training_config` ([`line 371`](../../../runversionone.py:371)).
- **Fallback MSE Improvement:** The 10% improvement assumption for `optimized_mse` fallback ([`line 388`](../../../runversionone.py:388)) is hardcoded.
- **Logging Messages:** Various informational and error messages are hardcoded strings.

No hardcoded secrets (like API keys or passwords) were found.

## Coupling Points

- **Pulse Module Interfaces:** The script is tightly coupled to the specific APIs and expected behaviors of imported Pulse modules:
    - [`WorldState`](../../../runversionone.py:7) and its components ([`Variables`](../../../runversionone.py:8), [`SymbolicOverlays`](../../../runversionone.py:8), [`CapitalExposure`](../../../runversionone.py:8)) structure and snapshot format.
    - [`simulate_forward()`](../../../runversionone.py:7) function signature and behavior.
    - [`RecursiveDataStore`](../../../runversionone.py:9) interface and data format.
    - [`LearningEngine`](../../../runversionone.py:11) (assumed interaction for metrics).
    - [`run_parallel_retrodiction_training()`](../../../runversionone.py:12) function signature and expected return structure.
- **Historical Data Structure:** Assumes a specific structure for historical data records (dictionaries with 'timestamp' and 'value' keys) as retrieved from [`RecursiveDataStore`](../../../runversionone.py:9) and processed by `HistoricalDataLoader`.
- **Configuration within Script:** Many key parameters (variable lists, simulation turns, date ranges) are defined directly within the script, making it less flexible without code modification.

## Existing Tests

- There is no dedicated test file (e.g., in a `tests/` directory) specifically for unit testing the components of [`runversionone.py`](../../../runversionone.py) itself (like `HistoricalDataLoader` or the logic within `establish_baseline_accuracy`).
- The script itself functions as an integration or end-to-end test/demonstration of the baseline establishment and parallel training pipeline. Its successful execution and output serve as a form of test for the integrated components it uses.

## Module Architecture and Flow

The script follows a procedural flow, primarily orchestrated within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

1.  **Setup:**
    *   Basic logging is configured.
    *   The `HistoricalDataLoader` class is defined to manage and provide historical data.
    *   Helper functions `load_historical_data_for_baseline()` and `list_available_historical_datasets()` are defined.
2.  **Baseline Accuracy Establishment (`establish_baseline_accuracy` function):**
    *   Loads historical data for specified variables using `load_historical_data_for_baseline()` and `HistoricalDataLoader`.
    *   Initializes a `WorldState` object, attempting to populate it with the first historical snapshot.
    *   Iterates for a specified number of simulation turns:
        *   For each turn, it simulates one step forward from the *previous actual historical state* using `simulate_forward()`.
        *   It retrieves the *current actual historical state* (ground truth) for comparison.
        *   It computes Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the simulated state and the ground truth state for variables, overlays, and capital using an internal `compute_full_state_error` function.
        *   The state for the next simulation step is reset to the current ground truth to avoid error accumulation in the baseline measurement itself (i.e., each turn's prediction is from a "clean" historical start).
    *   Calculates and returns average MSE metrics over all simulated turns.
3.  **Main Execution (`if __name__ == "__main__":`):**
    *   **Step 1: Run Baseline:**
        *   Defines `baseline_variables` and `baseline_simulation_turns`.
        *   Calls `establish_baseline_accuracy()` and logs the resulting metrics.
    *   **Step 2: Run Optimized Parallel Training:**
        *   Defines `training_config` including variables, start/end times, worker count, batch size, and output file.
        *   Calls `run_parallel_retrodiction_training()` with this configuration.
        *   Logs performance metrics from the training results.
        *   Compares the `final_mse` (if available from training results, otherwise a fallback) with the baseline MSE and logs the percentage improvement.
4.  **Logging:** Throughout the process, informational messages, warnings, and errors are logged to the console.

## Naming Conventions

- **Classes:** `HistoricalDataLoader`, `WorldState`, `Variables`, etc., follow CamelCase (PascalCase) convention (PEP 8).
- **Functions:** `load_historical_data_for_baseline`, `establish_baseline_accuracy`, `simulate_forward`, etc., use snake_case (PEP 8).
- **Variables:** `historical_data`, `simulation_turns`, `training_config`, etc., use snake_case (PEP 8).
- **Constants/Configuration Variables:** Variables like `baseline_variables` are in snake_case, which is acceptable for module-level constants if not intended for export as true constants. True constants are typically UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- **Clarity:** Names are generally descriptive and clearly indicate the purpose of the corresponding class, function, or variable.
- No significant deviations from PEP 8 or AI assumption errors in naming were observed.

## SPARC Compliance Summary

- **Specification:** The module has a clear, specific purpose: to establish a baseline for retrodiction accuracy and compare it against an optimized parallel training approach. It appears to fulfill this specification.
- **Testability:**
    - Lacks dedicated unit tests for its own internal logic (e.g., `HistoricalDataLoader`, error calculation within `establish_baseline_accuracy`).
    - The script itself acts as an integration test for the components it orchestrates.
- **Maintainability:**
    - Fair. The code is reasonably well-structured with functions and a class.
    - Reduced by hardcoded parameters (variable lists, simulation settings, file names) and assumptions about the interfaces and data structures of external Pulse modules. Changes to these would require code modification.
- **No Hardcoding (Secrets):** Compliant. No sensitive secrets like API keys or passwords are hardcoded.
- **No Hardcoding (Config/Paths):** Partially compliant. While no absolute paths are hardcoded, several configuration parameters (variable names, simulation turns, date ranges, output filenames) are embedded directly in the script.
- **Modularity:**
    - The script is a single file but achieves some internal modularity through functions and the `HistoricalDataLoader` class.
    - It relies heavily on external modules for core functionalities.
- **Security:** Not a primary concern for this type of offline analysis/training script, beyond general good coding practices. No external network calls that require authentication are made directly by this script, other than those potentially made by underlying modules like `RecursiveDataStore` or `run_parallel_retrodiction_training`.
- **Scalability/Extensibility:**
    - The parallel training part is designed for scalability by using `ParallelTrainingCoordinator`.
    - The script's own extensibility (e.g., to easily change variables, time periods, or comparison metrics) is limited by hardcoding. Configuration files would improve this.

Overall, [`runversionone.py`](../../../runversionone.py) is a valuable script for its intended purpose of benchmarking and demonstrating the retrodiction and training pipeline. Key areas for SPARC improvement would be to enhance its testability with unit tests for its components and to externalize configurations to improve maintainability and extensibility.
