# Module Analysis: `forecast_engine/forecast_memory.py`

## 1. Purpose

The `forecast_engine/forecast_memory.py` module is responsible for archiving forecast metadata snapshots. This allows for long-term storage of forecast data, which can then be used for validation, historical analysis, learning processes, and other retrospective activities within the Pulse system. It acts as an interface to the underlying forecast memory storage mechanism.

## 2. Key Functionalities

*   **Saving Forecasts (`save_forecast_to_memory`)**:
    *   Takes a `forecast_id`, `metadata` dictionary (containing trust, symbolic, and scoring information), and an optional `domain` tag.
    *   Constructs a forecast entry dictionary.
    *   Uses an instance of the [`ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:0) class (from the `memory` module) to store this entry.
    *   Returns the stored entry.
*   **Loading Forecast History (`load_forecast_history`)**:
    *   Retrieves a list of recent forecast memory entries.
    *   Accepts a `limit` for the number of entries to load (defaults to 10).
    *   Allows filtering of entries by an optional `domain_filter`.
    *   Delegates the retrieval to the `get_recent` method of the [`ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:0) instance.
*   **Initialization**:
    *   Checks if the `memory_guardian` module is enabled in [`MODULES_ENABLED`](core/pulse_config.py:0) from [`core.pulse_config`](core/pulse_config.py:0). If not, it raises a `RuntimeError`, preventing the module from operating if its dependencies or related systems are disabled.
    *   Initializes a global `forecast_memory` instance of [`ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:0), configuring its persistence directory using `PATHS["FORECAST_HISTORY"]` from [`core.path_registry`](core/path_registry.py:0).

## 3. Role within `forecast_engine/`

This module serves as the primary interface for other components within the `forecast_engine/` (and potentially other parts of Pulse) to interact with the long-term storage of forecast data. It abstracts the actual storage mechanism (provided by [`analytics.forecast_memory.ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:0)) and provides simple functions for saving new forecasts and retrieving historical ones. This is crucial for learning from past performance, auditing, and providing data for more advanced analyses like divergence tracking (mentioned as a future extension).

## 4. Dependencies

### Internal Pulse Modules:

*   [`core.pulse_config`](core/pulse_config.py:0): Imports `MODULES_ENABLED` to check if dependent systems (like `memory_guardian`) are active.
*   [`core.path_registry`](core/path_registry.py:0): Imports `PATHS` to determine the storage directory for forecast history.
*   [`analytics.forecast_memory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:0): Imports the `ForecastMemory` class, which provides the core logic for storing and retrieving forecast data from persistent storage. This is a critical dependency.
*   [`utils.log_utils`](utils/log_utils.py:0): Imports [`get_logger()`](utils/log_utils.py:0) for standardized logging.

### External Libraries:

*   `os`: Likely used by the underlying [`ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:0) class for file system operations, though not directly in this module's functions.
*   `json`: Likely used by [`ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:0) for serializing/deserializing forecast data, though not directly in this module's functions.
*   `datetime`: Imported but not directly used in the provided snippet; potentially used by [`ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:0) or intended for future use (e.g., timestamping within this module if not handled by `ForecastMemory`).
*   `typing`: Used for type hints (`Dict`, `Any`, `Optional`, `List`).

## 5. Adherence to SPARC Principles

*   **Simplicity**: The functions exposed by this module ([`save_forecast_to_memory()`](forecast_engine/forecast_memory.py:35) and [`load_forecast_history()`](forecast_engine/forecast_memory.py:54)) are simple wrappers, making interaction with the forecast memory straightforward.
*   **Iterate**: The module docstring explicitly mentions "Future extensions" like clustering, divergence tracking, and rule echo memory, indicating a clear plan for iterative development and enhancement.
*   **Focus**: The module is sharply focused on the tasks of saving and loading forecast metadata to/from a persistent store. It correctly delegates the complexities of storage to the specialized [`ForecastMemory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:0) class.
*   **Quality**:
    *   Functions are well-docstringed, explaining arguments, and return values.
    *   Type hinting is used, improving code readability and maintainability.
    *   There's a configuration check for `MODULES_ENABLED.get("memory_guardian", True)`, which is good practice for ensuring system integrity.
    *   An `assert` statement checks the type of `PATHS`.
*   **Collaboration**: It effectively collaborates with the [`analytics.forecast_memory`](memory/forecast_memory.py:0) module by instantiating and using the `ForecastMemory` class, demonstrating good modular design and separation of concerns.

## 6. Overall Assessment

*   **Completeness**: For its current defined scope (saving and retrieving basic forecast entries), the module is complete. The planned future extensions will add more advanced capabilities.
*   **Clarity**: The code is very clear and easy to understand. The purpose of each function is evident, and the interaction with the `ForecastMemory` class is straightforward.
*   **Quality**: The module exhibits good quality through clear code, docstrings, type hints, and a sensible separation of concerns by using a dedicated class from another module for the core storage logic. The conditional check based on `MODULES_ENABLED` adds to its robustness in a larger system.

## 7. Recommendations

*   Ensure that the `datetime` import is utilized or remove it if it's not needed by this module directly (it might be used by the underlying `ForecastMemory` class, in which case its presence here is less critical but not harmful).
*   The module-level docstring is good. Consider adding a brief example of usage for [`save_forecast_to_memory()`](forecast_engine/forecast_memory.py:35) and [`load_forecast_history()`](forecast_engine/forecast_memory.py:54) within their respective docstrings or in a module usage example section if this were to be more extensive standalone documentation.
