# Module Analysis: iris/iris_utils/conftest.py

## Module Intent/Purpose
This module serves as a pytest configuration file (`conftest.py`) for the `ingestion.iris_utils` package. Its primary role is to define and provide fixtures that can be used by tests within this package.

## Operational Status/Completeness
The module appears complete for its current, limited purpose of providing a single pytest fixture. There are no obvious placeholders or TODO comments.

## Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps
Based on the current content, there are no clear indications of intended future extensions or unfinished steps within this specific file. Its purpose is narrow (providing test fixtures), and it fulfills that role.

## Connections & Dependencies
*   **Direct Imports:**
    *   [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) (External library)
*   **External Library Dependencies:** `pytest`
*   **Interaction with other modules:** None evident from the code. Fixtures defined here are intended for use by test files within the same package or subpackages.
*   **Input/output files:** None evident.

## Function and Class Example Usages
The module defines one pytest fixture:

### `variable_name()`
This fixture provides the string value `"test_variable"`. It is scoped to the session, meaning the function is executed once per test session.

```python
# Example usage in a test file within iris/iris_utils/
def test_something_with_variable(variable_name):
    assert variable_name == "test_variable"
```

## Hardcoding Issues
The string `"test_variable"` is hardcoded. This is acceptable as it is part of a test fixture designed to provide a specific, predictable value for testing purposes.

## Coupling Points
The module is coupled with the `pytest` framework and any test files within the `ingestion.iris_utils` package that utilize the `variable_name` fixture.

## Existing Tests
This file itself is part of the testing infrastructure. The presence of `iris/iris_utils/test_historical_data_pipeline.py` suggests that tests exist in this directory that could potentially utilize the fixtures defined here. The `conftest.py` file is specifically for providing fixtures to tests.

## Module Architecture and Flow
The architecture is very simple, consisting only of a pytest fixture definition. There is no complex control or data flow within this file itself.

## Naming Conventions
Naming conventions follow standard Python and pytest practices (e.g., `test_something`, `variable_name` for a fixture). There are no obvious deviations or potential AI assumption errors.
