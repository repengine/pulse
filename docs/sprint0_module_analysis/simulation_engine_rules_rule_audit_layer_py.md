# Module Analysis: `simulation_engine/rules/rule_audit_layer.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`simulation_engine/rules/rule_audit_layer.py`](../../simulation_engine/rules/rule_audit_layer.py:1) module is to log detailed audit traces for each rule executed during a simulation turn. Its responsibilities include:
- Capturing rule execution metadata such as rule ID, symbolic tags, and changes (deltas) to worldstate variables and overlays.
- Providing data that enables downstream processes like forecast scoring, drift monitoring, and justification of simulation outcomes.
- Serving as a traceability component for simulation and forecast engines.

The module explicitly does not handle rule matching or validation.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be operationally complete for its defined, narrow scope.
- It consists of a single function, [`audit_rule()`](../../simulation_engine/rules/rule_audit_layer.py:18), which is fully implemented.
- There are no obvious placeholders, `TODO` comments, or incomplete code sections.
- The logic for identifying and recording deltas in variables and overlays is present.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Data Persistence/Logging:** The module generates an audit dictionary but does not handle its storage or logging. A logical next step would be to integrate a mechanism (e.g., a logging service, database writer, or file appender) to persist these audit records.
- **Consumer Modules:** While the module is designed to "enable forecast scoring, drift monitoring, and justification," the actual modules or functions performing these tasks are not part of this module and would be consumers of its output.
- The module fulfills its specific task of creating an audit record; further development would likely focus on the systems that consume these records.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Project-Internal Dependencies:
- `from engine.worldstate import WorldState`: Imports the [`WorldState`](../../simulation_engine/worldstate.py:1) class, which is crucial for comparing states before and after rule execution.

### External Library Dependencies:
- `from typing import Dict, Any`: Uses standard Python typing features.

### Data Interaction:
- **Input:** Takes [`WorldState`](../../simulation_engine/worldstate.py:1) objects (`state_before`, `state_after`), `rule_id` (string), `symbolic_tags` (list of strings), and `turn` (integer) as input.
- **Output:** Produces a dictionary containing the audit trace. This dictionary is intended for consumption by other system components.
- No direct file I/O is performed by this module.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

### Function: [`audit_rule(rule_id: str, state_before: WorldState, state_after: WorldState, symbolic_tags: list[str], turn: int) -> Dict[str, Any]`](../../simulation_engine/rules/rule_audit_layer.py:18)
This function is called after a simulation rule has been applied to capture the changes and context.

**Example Usage:**
```python
from engine.worldstate import WorldState # Assuming WorldState and its methods are defined
from engine.rules.rule_audit_layer import audit_rule

# Dummy WorldState instances for demonstration
class MockVariables:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self._data = data
    def as_dict(self):
        return self._data

class MockWorldState(WorldState):
    def __init__(self, variables_data, overlays_data):
        self.variables = MockVariables(variables_data)
        self.overlays = MockVariables(overlays_data)

# Initialize states
state_before_execution = MockWorldState(
    variables_data={"var1": 10.0, "var2": "active"},
    overlays_data={"overlay1": 100.5}
)
state_after_execution = MockWorldState(
    variables_data={"var1": 15.0, "var2": "inactive", "var3": 5.0},
    overlays_data={"overlay1": 100.5, "overlay2": 20.0}
)

current_turn = 5
executed_rule_id = "price_update_rule_001"
tags = ["economic", "price_adjustment"]

audit_record = audit_rule(
    rule_id=executed_rule_id,
    state_before=state_before_execution,
    state_after=state_after_execution,
    symbolic_tags=tags,
    turn=current_turn
)

# The audit_record would then be logged or processed by another part of the system.
# Expected output structure:
# {
#     "rule_id": "price_update_rule_001",
#     "timestamp": 5,
#     "symbolic_tags": ["economic", "price_adjustment"],
#     "variables_changed": {
#         "var1": {"from": 10.0, "to": 15.0},
#         "var2": {"from": "active", "to": "inactive"},
#         "var3": {"from": None, "to": 5.0} # Assuming get() returns None for new keys
#     },
#     "overlays_changed": {
#         "overlay2": {"from": None, "to": 20.0}
#     }
# }
print(audit_record)
```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

- **Rounding Precision:** The numerical rounding precision is hardcoded to `4` decimal places (e.g., [`round(before_val, 4)`](../../simulation_engine/rules/rule_audit_layer.py:33)). This might be better as a configurable parameter if different levels of precision are needed elsewhere or if this standard changes.
- **Dictionary Keys:** The keys used in the output dictionary (`"rule_id"`, `"timestamp"`, `"symbolic_tags"`, `"variables_changed"`, `"overlays_changed"`, `"from"`, `"to"`) are hardcoded strings. This is standard practice for defining data structures but forms part of the module's contract with consumers.

## 7. Coupling Points

- **[`WorldState`](../../simulation_engine/worldstate.py:1) Structure:** The module is tightly coupled to the [`WorldState`](../../simulation_engine/worldstate.py:1) object's structure, specifically relying on its `variables.as_dict()` and `overlays.as_dict()` methods. Any changes to these aspects of [`WorldState`](../../simulation_engine/worldstate.py:1) could impact this module.
- **Output Format:** The structure of the dictionary returned by [`audit_rule()`](../../simulation_engine/rules/rule_audit_layer.py:18) defines an interface. Downstream consumers of this audit data will depend on this specific format.

## 8. Existing Tests

A search in the `tests/simulation_engine/rules/` directory did not reveal a specific test file for this module (e.g., `test_rule_audit_layer.py`). Therefore, it is presumed that dedicated unit tests for this module are currently missing or located elsewhere in the project's test structure.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

- **Architecture:** The module is simple, containing a single, stateless function [`audit_rule()`](../../simulation_engine/rules/rule_audit_layer.py:18).
- **Control Flow:**
    1. The [`audit_rule()`](../../simulation_engine/rules/rule_audit_layer.py:18) function is invoked with the rule's ID, the world state before and after the rule's execution, associated symbolic tags, and the current simulation turn number.
    2. It initializes two empty dictionaries, `var_deltas` and `overlay_deltas`, to store changes.
    3. It iterates through the variables of `state_before.variables.as_dict()`. For each variable, it compares its value with the corresponding value in `state_after.variables.as_dict()`.
    4. If a difference is found, it records the 'from' and 'to' values in `var_deltas`. Numerical values are rounded to 4 decimal places.
    5. A similar process is repeated for `state_before.overlays.as_dict()` and `state_after.overlays.as_dict()`, populating `overlay_deltas`.
    6. Finally, it constructs and returns a dictionary containing `rule_id`, `timestamp` (turn number), `symbolic_tags`, `variables_changed` (the `var_deltas`), and `overlays_changed` (the `overlay_deltas`).

## 10. Naming Conventions

- **Module Name:** [`rule_audit_layer.py`](../../simulation_engine/rules/rule_audit_layer.py:1) is descriptive and follows Python conventions.
- **Function Name:** [`audit_rule()`](../../simulation_engine/rules/rule_audit_layer.py:18) clearly indicates its purpose.
- **Variables:** Names like `rule_id`, `state_before`, `state_after`, `symbolic_tags`, `turn`, `var_deltas`, `overlay_deltas` are clear, descriptive, and adhere to PEP 8 (snake_case).
- Loop variables (`key`, `before_val`, `after_val`) are generic but suitable for their context.
- Overall, naming conventions are consistent and align with Python best practices. No apparent AI-induced naming errors were observed.
