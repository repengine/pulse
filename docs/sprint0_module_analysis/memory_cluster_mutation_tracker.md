# SPARC Analysis Report: analytics.cluster_mutation_tracker

**File Path:** [`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:1)
**Analysis Date:** 2025-05-13

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose (SPARC: Specification)

The primary role of the `cluster_mutation_tracker.py` module is to identify the most "evolved" forecast within different symbolic clusters. Evolution is primarily determined by the depth of a forecast's ancestry chain (i.e., the number of preceding forecasts it's derived from, termed "mutation depth"). The module aims to select these evolved forecasts as ideal representatives for long-term memory storage or further analysis.

Key functionalities include:
- Calculating the mutation depth of individual forecasts.
- Grouping forecasts into narrative clusters using an external classification function.
- Selecting the forecast with the maximum mutation depth from each cluster.
- Summarizing the maximum mutation depth for each cluster.
- Exporting the selected "leader" forecasts to a JSONL file.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be largely complete and operational for its defined purpose.
- All functions have implementations.
- Logging is integrated for warnings and errors.
- Error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks, type checks for file paths) is present in key areas like file export and selection logic.
- A basic inline test suite (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) exists, suggesting core functionality has been verified to some extent.
- No obvious `TODO` comments or `pass` statements indicating unfinished critical logic were found in the main functional code.

The main indication of potential incompleteness is the commented-out call to [`export_mutation_leaders()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:165) in the inline test block, suggesting this part might not be run by default during simple tests or its integration into a larger automated workflow might be pending.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

- **Comprehensive Testing:** The existing inline test ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:153-165`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:153)) is described as "minimal." A significant next step would be to develop a formal test suite (e.g., using `pytest` or `unittest`) with broader coverage, including:
    - Edge cases for input data (empty lists, malformed forecast dictionaries).
    - Behavior when `classify_forecast_cluster` returns unexpected values or raises errors.
    - Thorough testing of the [`export_mutation_leaders()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120) function, including I/O errors, permission issues, and successful file creation/replacement.
    - Testing the `ForecastMemory` object input path for [`track_cluster_lineage()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44).
- **Configuration:** Some hardcoded elements (see Section 6) like file extensions or logging levels could be made configurable, perhaps via a configuration file or environment variables, for greater flexibility.
- **Integration with `ForecastMemory`:** The module accepts a `ForecastMemory` object or a list of forecasts. The interaction with `ForecastMemory` (specifically accessing `_memory`) could be further formalized or tested.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

### Direct Imports:
- **Standard Libraries:**
    - `json`: Used for serializing forecast data in [`export_mutation_leaders()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120).
    - `os`: Used for file operations (`os.replace`, `os.remove`, `os.path.exists`) in [`export_mutation_leaders()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120).
    - `logging`: Used for application-level logging throughout the module.
    - `typing` (`List`, `Dict`): Used for type hinting to improve code clarity and maintainability.
    - `collections` (`defaultdict`): Used in [`track_cluster_lineage()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44) to simplify grouping forecasts by cluster.
- **Internal Project Modules:**
    - `forecast_output.forecast_cluster_classifier`: Specifically, the [`classify_forecast_cluster()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:20) function is imported and used in [`track_cluster_lineage()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44) to determine the narrative cluster for each forecast.

### Interactions:
- **Data Structures:**
    - Expects input `forecasts` as either a list of dictionaries or a `ForecastMemory` object (which is expected to have a `_memory` attribute containing such a list).
    - Each forecast dictionary is expected to have a specific structure, notably a `lineage` dictionary containing an `ancestors` list (e.g., `forecast.get("lineage", {}).get("ancestors", [])`).
- **File System:**
    - The [`export_mutation_leaders()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120) function writes output to a `.jsonl` file specified by a path argument. It uses a temporary file (`<path>.tmp`) during this process to ensure atomicity of the write operation.

### Input/Output Files:
- **Input:** While not directly reading files itself (apart from the Python source), the module processes forecast data that would typically be loaded from files (e.g., JSON, CSV) in an upstream component.
- **Output:** [`export_mutation_leaders()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120) generates a `.jsonl` file containing the most evolved forecast for each cluster.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

(No classes are defined in this module.)

- **[`get_mutation_depth(forecast: Dict) -> int`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:26)**
    - **Purpose:** Calculates the mutation depth of a forecast by counting its ancestors.
    - **Example:**
      ```python
      forecast_data = {"id": 1, "lineage": {"ancestors": ["anc1", "anc2"]}}
      depth = get_mutation_depth(forecast_data)
      # depth would be 2
      ```

- **[`track_cluster_lineage(forecasts) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44)**
    - **Purpose:** Groups forecasts by their narrative cluster using `classify_forecast_cluster`.
    - **Example:**
      ```python
      # Assuming classify_forecast_cluster is defined and imported
      # and returns "ClusterA" for forecast1, "ClusterB" for forecast2
      forecast_list = [
          {"id": "f1", "data": "...", "lineage": {"ancestors": []}},
          {"id": "f2", "data": "...", "lineage": {"ancestors": ["f1"]}}
      ]
      # Mocking classify_forecast_cluster for example:
      # def classify_forecast_cluster(fc): return "ClusterA" if fc["id"] == "f1" else "ClusterB"
      
      clustered_data = track_cluster_lineage(forecast_list)
      # clustered_data might be:
      # {
      #   "ClusterA": [{"id": "f1", ..., "narrative_cluster": "ClusterA"}],
      #   "ClusterB": [{"id": "f2", ..., "narrative_cluster": "ClusterB"}]
      # }
      ```

- **[`select_most_evolved(clusters: Dict[str, List[Dict]], mutation_depth_fn=get_mutation_depth) -> Dict[str, Dict]`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:66)**
    - **Purpose:** Selects the forecast with the highest mutation depth from each cluster.
    - **Example:**
      ```python
      # Using clustered_data from the previous example
      leader_forecasts = select_most_evolved(clustered_data)
      # Assuming forecast "f2" has greater depth in "ClusterB"
      # leader_forecasts might be:
      # {
      #   "ClusterA": {"id": "f1", ..., "narrative_cluster": "ClusterA"},
      #   "ClusterB": {"id": "f2", ..., "narrative_cluster": "ClusterB"}
      # }
      ```

- **[`summarize_mutation_depths(clusters: Dict[str, List[Dict]], mutation_depth_fn=get_mutation_depth) -> Dict[str, int]`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:93)**
    - **Purpose:** Calculates the maximum mutation depth found within each forecast cluster.
    - **Example:**
      ```python
      # Using clustered_data from track_cluster_lineage example
      depth_summary = summarize_mutation_depths(clustered_data)
      # depth_summary might be: {"ClusterA": 0, "ClusterB": 1}
      ```

- **[`export_mutation_leaders(leaders: Dict[str, Dict], path: str)`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120)**
    - **Purpose:** Saves the identified leader forecasts to a JSONL file.
    - **Example:**
      ```python
      # Using leader_forecasts from select_most_evolved example
      output_file_path = "output/cluster_leaders.jsonl"
      export_mutation_leaders(leader_forecasts, output_file_path)
      # This would create "output/cluster_leaders.jsonl" with each leader on a new line.
      ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues (SPARC Critical)

The following instances of hardcoding were identified:

- **File Extensions/Suffixes:**
    - The `.jsonl` extension is explicitly checked for and expected in [`export_mutation_leaders()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:131).
    - The temporary file suffix `".tmp"` is hardcoded in [`export_mutation_leaders()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:134).
- **Dictionary Keys:**
    - `"lineage"` ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:36`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:36), etc.)
    - `"ancestors"` ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:37`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:37), etc.)
    - `"narrative_cluster"` ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:61`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:61))
    These string literals are used to access expected fields within forecast dictionaries. While common, this makes the code reliant on this specific data structure.
- **Logging Configuration:**
    - The default logging level is set to `logging.INFO` ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:23`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:23)). This could ideally be configurable.
- **Test Data & Parameters:**
    - The `test_forecasts` data within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:155-159`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:155)) is hardcoded. This is typical for simple inline tests but constitutes hardcoding.
    - The commented-out output filename `"test_leaders.jsonl"` ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:165`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:165)) in the test block.

No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or sensitive absolute paths were identified. The hardcoding found relates more to structural assumptions and fixed values that might benefit from external configuration for greater flexibility.

## 7. Coupling Points

- **`forecast_output.forecast_cluster_classifier.classify_forecast_cluster`:** The [`track_cluster_lineage()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44) function is directly coupled to this external function. Any changes to the signature, behavior, or contract of `classify_forecast_cluster` would directly impact this module.
- **Forecast Dictionary Structure:** The module, particularly [`get_mutation_depth()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:26), is tightly coupled to the expected structure of forecast dictionaries (i.e., the presence and format of `lineage` and `ancestors` keys).
- **`ForecastMemory` Object Structure:** The [`track_cluster_lineage()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44) function checks `if hasattr(forecasts, "_memory")`, indicating an expected internal structure for `ForecastMemory` objects. This creates coupling to that specific class implementation detail.
- **`mutation_depth_fn` Interface:** Functions like [`select_most_evolved()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:66) and [`summarize_mutation_depths()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:93) expect `mutation_depth_fn` to take a forecast dictionary and return an integer.

## 8. Existing Tests (SPARC Refinement)

- **Location & Type:** A basic test block is provided within an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:153-165`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:153)). This is an inline script for quick, direct execution, not part of a formal testing framework.
- **Coverage:**
    - It covers the primary success path for [`track_cluster_lineage()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44), [`select_most_evolved()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:66), and [`summarize_mutation_depths()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:93) using a small, hardcoded dataset.
    - The [`get_mutation_depth()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:26) function is implicitly tested through its use as the default `mutation_depth_fn`.
    - The [`export_mutation_leaders()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120) function is present in the test block but its call is commented out ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:165`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:165)), meaning file I/O operations are not tested by default with this script.
- **Quality & Gaps:**
    - The test is minimal, as stated in its comment ([`memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:154`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:154)).
    - **Missing Edge Case Testing:** Does not cover scenarios like:
        - Empty input `forecasts` list.
        - Forecasts missing `lineage` or `ancestors` keys (though [`get_mutation_depth()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:26) handles missing keys gracefully by returning 0).
        - `ancestors` field being present but not a list (handled with a warning in [`get_mutation_depth()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:38), but not explicitly tested).
        - Empty clusters after classification.
        - Errors raised by the `mutation_depth_fn` itself.
    - **No `ForecastMemory` Test:** The alternative input type `ForecastMemory` for [`track_cluster_lineage()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44) is not tested.
    - **No I/O Testing for Export:** As mentioned, [`export_mutation_leaders()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120) is not actively tested, so file write success, various `OSError` conditions, permission issues, or other exceptions during export are not covered. The `ValueError` for an invalid path is also not tested.
    - **Lack of Assertions:** The test block prints results to the console but lacks formal assertions to automatically verify correctness.
- **Problematic Tests:** Not problematic in themselves, but insufficient for robust validation.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow (SPARC Architecture)

- **High-Level Structure:** The module consists of a set of utility functions designed to process collections of forecast data. It does not define any classes.
- **Key Components & Data Flow:**
    1.  **Input:** A list of forecast dictionaries (or a `ForecastMemory` object).
    2.  **[`get_mutation_depth(forecast)`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:26):**
        - Input: Single forecast dictionary.
        - Process: Extracts the `ancestors` list from `forecast['lineage']['ancestors']`.
        - Output: Integer representing the number of ancestors (mutation depth).
    3.  **[`track_cluster_lineage(forecasts)`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44):**
        - Input: List of forecasts (or `ForecastMemory` object).
        - Process:
            - If input is `ForecastMemory`, extracts the internal list.
            - Iterates through forecasts. For each forecast:
                - Calls `classify_forecast_cluster(fc)` to get its cluster label.
                - Adds a `narrative_cluster` key to the forecast dictionary.
                - Appends the forecast to a list associated with its cluster label in a `defaultdict(list)`.
        - Output: `Dict[str, List[Dict]]` mapping cluster labels to lists of forecasts belonging to that cluster.
    4.  **[`select_most_evolved(clusters, mutation_depth_fn)`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:66):**
        - Input: Dictionary of clustered forecasts from `track_cluster_lineage`. An optional `mutation_depth_fn` (defaults to `get_mutation_depth`).
        - Process: Iterates through each cluster. If the cluster is not empty, it uses `max(fc_list, key=mutation_depth_fn)` to find the forecast with the greatest mutation depth. Handles potential exceptions during this process.
        - Output: `Dict[str, Dict]` mapping cluster labels to the single most evolved forecast dictionary from that cluster.
    5.  **[`summarize_mutation_depths(clusters, mutation_depth_fn)`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:93):**
        - Input: Dictionary of clustered forecasts. An optional `mutation_depth_fn`.
        - Process: Iterates through each cluster. If not empty, calculates `max(mutation_depth_fn(fc) for fc in fc_list)`. Handles exceptions.
        - Output: `Dict[str, int]` mapping cluster labels to the maximum mutation depth found in that cluster.
    6.  **[`export_mutation_leaders(leaders, path)`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:120):**
        - Input: Dictionary of leader forecasts from `select_most_evolved`, and an output file `path`.
        - Process:
            - Validates the `path` ends with `.jsonl`.
            - Writes each leader forecast dictionary as a JSON string to a new line in a temporary file (`<path>.tmp`).
            - Atomically replaces the target `path` with the temporary file.
            - Handles `OSError` and other exceptions during file operations, including cleanup of the temporary file.
        - Output: A `.jsonl` file at the specified `path`.
- **Modularity:** The functions are well-defined and handle specific parts of the overall task, contributing to good modularity. The use of `mutation_depth_fn` as a parameter allows for flexible definition of "evolution" without altering the core selection logic.

## 10. Naming Conventions (SPARC Maintainability)

- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Function names (e.g., [`get_mutation_depth()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:26), [`track_cluster_lineage()`](memory/cluster_mutation_tracker.py:44)) and variable names (e.g., `forecasts`, `clusters`, `fc_list`) generally follow PEP 8 (snake_case for functions and variables).
- **Clarity:** Names are largely descriptive and clearly indicate the purpose or content of the variable/function (e.g., `mutation_depth_fn`, `leaders`, `summary`).
- **Module Name:** `cluster_mutation_tracker.py` accurately reflects the module's functionality.
- **Docstrings:** The module and all public functions have docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values, which significantly aids maintainability.
- **Logging:** Logger instance is named `logger`, which is a common convention. Log messages are informative.
- **Potential AI Assumption Errors:** No obvious naming choices that would likely lead to misinterpretation by an AI code assistant were observed. The names are standard and semantically clear.

Overall, naming conventions are good and contribute positively to the module's readability and maintainability.

## 11. SPARC Compliance Summary

- **Specification:** **Compliant.** The module's purpose and the functionality of its components are clearly specified through docstrings and its overall structure.
- **Modularity/Architecture:** **Largely Compliant.** The module is broken down into distinct, cohesive functions. It effectively delegates clustering to an external module (`forecast_cluster_classifier`), adhering to separation of concerns. The data flow is logical. The slight coupling to `ForecastMemory._memory` is a minor point.
- **Refinement Focus:**
    - **Testability:** **Needs Improvement.** While basic inline tests exist, they lack comprehensiveness, formal assertion, and coverage of edge cases or I/O operations. A dedicated test suite is needed.
    - **Security (No Hardcoding of Secrets):** **Compliant.** No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or sensitive credentials were found. Hardcoding is limited to structural elements like dictionary keys and file extensions/suffixes, which are not direct security vulnerabilities in this context but could affect flexibility.
    - **Maintainability:** **Good.** Code is clear, well-documented with docstrings, uses consistent and descriptive naming, and includes logging.
- **No Hardcoding (General):** **Partially Compliant.** As noted, some hardcoding of non-sensitive values (dictionary keys, file extensions, logging level) exists. While not critical, reducing this would improve configurability and robustness to structural changes in data.

**Overall SPARC Adherence:** The module demonstrates good adherence to SPARC principles in terms of specification, modularity, and general maintainability. The primary area for improvement is in **Testability** (Refinement) by developing a comprehensive, formal test suite. Addressing minor hardcoding issues would further enhance its robustness and flexibility.
