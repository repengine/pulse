# Module Analysis: `operator_interface/rule_cluster_viewer.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of [`operator_interface/rule_cluster_viewer.py`](../../operator_interface/rule_cluster_viewer.py:1) is to display rule clusters, categorized by domain and volatility, for operator review. As stated in its docstring, it is intended for use in trust diagnostics, mutation targeting, and providing an overview of the symbolic system. It essentially provides a human-readable digest of rule cluster information.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its stated, limited purpose of printing a digest of rule clusters to the console. It is a small, focused utility. There are no obvious placeholders, `TODO` comments, or unfinished sections within the provided code.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Extensibility:** While functional, the module is basic. It could be extended to offer more sophisticated display options, such as different output formats (e.g., JSON, HTML for a web view, CSV), more advanced filtering or sorting capabilities beyond the current `limit` and `volatility_threshold`.
*   **Implied Features:** The module's purpose ("operator review", "trust diagnostics") implies that it serves as a component in a larger system for monitoring and managing rules. While the viewer itself is simple, its utility depends on the robustness of the underlying `rule_cluster_engine`. No direct follow-up modules are explicitly implied by this viewer, but its existence suggests a need for operator-facing tools.
*   **Development Path:** There are no clear indications that development started on a more extensive path and then deviated or stopped short for this specific module. It seems designed as a simple, direct utility.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Project Imports:**
    *   [`from analytics.rule_cluster_engine import summarize_rule_clusters`](../../operator_interface/rule_cluster_viewer.py:10): This is the core dependency, providing the data that the module visualizes.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   None apparent beyond standard Python libraries.
*   **Interaction via Shared Data:**
    *   The module consumes data returned by the [`summarize_rule_clusters()`](../../memory/rule_cluster_engine.py) function from the `memory` module. The structure of this data (expected to be a list of dictionaries with keys like `'cluster'`, `'size'`, `'volatility_score'`, and `'rules'`) is a key interaction point.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** None directly from files. Data is sourced from the imported function.
    *   **Output:** Prints directly to `stdout` (the console). It does not write to log files or other data files.

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module contains one primary function, [`render_cluster_digest()`](../../operator_interface/rule_cluster_viewer.py:12).

*   **`render_cluster_digest(limit: int = 10, volatility_threshold: float = 0.0)`**
    *   **Purpose:** Fetches rule cluster summaries and prints a formatted digest to the console.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `limit` (int, default: 10): The maximum number of clusters to display.
        *   `volatility_threshold` (float, default: 0.0): Only clusters with a volatility score greater than or equal to this threshold will be displayed.
    *   **Usage Example (from the module's `if __name__ == "__main__":` block):**
        ```python
        render_cluster_digest(limit=10, volatility_threshold=0.1)
        ```
        This would display up to 10 rule clusters that have a volatility score of 0.1 or higher.

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Parameter Values:**
    *   In [`render_cluster_digest()`](../../operator_interface/rule_cluster_viewer.py:12): `limit` defaults to `10`, `volatility_threshold` defaults to `0.0`.
*   **Script Execution Values:**
    *   In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ([`operator_interface/rule_cluster_viewer.py:27`](../../operator_interface/rule_cluster_viewer.py:27)), the function is called with `limit=10` and `volatility_threshold=0.1`. These are effectively hardcoded for direct script execution.
*   **Output Strings:**
    *   Descriptive strings for the output format are hardcoded (e.g., `"ðŸ“Š Rule Cluster Digest:"`, `"ðŸ“¦ Cluster:"`, `"Volatility Score:"`). This is typical for simple console output utilities.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **`analytics.rule_cluster_engine.summarize_rule_clusters()`:** The module is tightly coupled to this function. Any changes to the function signature or the structure of the data it returns would likely require modifications to [`rule_cluster_viewer.py`](../../operator_interface/rule_cluster_viewer.py:1).
*   **Output Format:** The current implementation is coupled to console-based output via the `print()` function. Changing to a different output mechanism (e.g., GUI, web, file) would require significant changes.

## 8. Existing Tests

*   No dedicated test file (e.g., `tests/operator_interface/test_rule_cluster_viewer.py` or `tests/test_rule_cluster_viewer.py`) was found in the provided file listings.
*   The module includes a basic execution block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) which allows it to be run directly, providing a simple form of manual testing or demonstration of its functionality.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

The module's architecture is straightforward:

1.  **Import Dependencies:** Imports [`summarize_rule_clusters`](../../memory/rule_cluster_engine.py) from [`analytics.rule_cluster_engine`](../../memory/rule_cluster_engine.py).
2.  **Define `render_cluster_digest` Function:**
    *   Takes `limit` and `volatility_threshold` as parameters.
    *   Calls [`summarize_rule_clusters()`](../../memory/rule_cluster_engine.py) to get cluster data.
    *   Prints a header string.
    *   Initializes a `count` for displayed clusters.
    *   Iterates through the retrieved `clusters`:
        *   If a cluster's `volatility_score` is below `volatility_threshold`, it's skipped.
        *   Increments `count`.
        *   Prints formatted cluster information (name/ID, size, volatility score).
        *   Iterates through the `rules` within that cluster and prints each rule.
        *   If `count` reaches `limit`, the loop breaks.
3.  **Main Execution Block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`):**
    *   Calls [`render_cluster_digest()`](../../operator_interface/rule_cluster_viewer.py:12) with specific arguments (`limit=10`, `volatility_threshold=0.1`) when the script is run directly.

The control flow is linear within the function: fetch data, then iterate and print based on conditions.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Module Name:** `rule_cluster_viewer.py` - Follows Python's snake_case convention and is descriptive.
*   **Function Name:** [`render_cluster_digest`](../../operator_interface/rule_cluster_viewer.py:12) - Follows snake_case and clearly describes its action.
*   **Variables:**
    *   `clusters`, `limit`, `volatility_threshold`, `count`: Clear and descriptive.
    *   `c` (for cluster in loop), `r` (for rule in loop): Common, concise iterator names in Python, generally acceptable for short loops.
*   **Overall:** Naming conventions appear consistent and generally adhere to PEP 8. No obvious AI assumption errors in naming are apparent.
