# Module Analysis: `learning/history_tracker.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The primary role of the [`learning/history_tracker.py`](learning/history_tracker.py:) module is to log the evolution of variables across different simulation steps. It aims to capture the timeline of each variable's state during a simulation run, saving this data into a structured JSONL file. This logging is intended to support subsequent introspection, graphing, and contribute to the long-term memory of the Pulse system's foresight activities.

## 2. Operational Status/Completeness

The module appears to be functionally complete for its defined scope, which is to write variable history to a file. It consists of a single public function, [`track_variable_history()`](learning/history_tracker.py:19), which performs this task. There are no explicit TODO comments or obvious placeholders in the provided code that would indicate unfinished core functionality. Basic error handling (printing warnings/errors to the console) is present.

## 3. Implementation Gaps / Unfinished Next Steps

*   **Data Consumption/Analysis Tools:** While the module's docstring mentions it "Supports introspection, graphing," the module itself only implements the data *writing* part. Functionality for reading, processing, analyzing, or visualizing the generated `.jsonl` files is not present and would constitute logical next steps or be expected in separate, complementary modules.
*   **Advanced Error Handling/Logging:** The current error handling is basic, printing messages to standard output (e.g., [`line 39`](learning/history_tracker.py:39), [`line 43`](learning/history_tracker.py:43), [`line 52`](learning/history_tracker.py:52), [`line 55`](learning/history_tracker.py:55)). A more robust system might involve logging to a dedicated logging framework or more sophisticated error recovery.
*   **Configuration:** The output directory and log file naming convention have hardcoded defaults/prefixes. More flexible configuration options could be beneficial.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **Direct Imports from Other Project Modules:** None are directly visible within the file itself. However, its location in the `learning` package and the usage example (`from analytics.history_tracker import track_variable_history`) imply it's designed to be used by other parts of the `learning` system or the broader Pulse project.
*   **External Library Dependencies:**
    *   [`os`](learning/history_tracker.py:14): Used for path manipulation (e.g., [`os.path.basename()`](learning/history_tracker.py:31), [`os.path.join()`](learning/history_tracker.py:33)) and directory creation ([`os.makedirs()`](learning/history_tracker.py:32)).
    *   [`json`](learning/history_tracker.py:15): Used for serializing dictionary records into JSON strings ([`json.dumps()`](learning/history_tracker.py:50)).
    *   [`typing`](learning/history_tracker.py:16): Used for type hinting (`List`, `Dict`).
*   **Interaction with Other Modules via Shared Data:**
    *   **Input:** The module consumes `state_snapshots` (a `List[Dict]`), which are presumably generated by a simulation engine or another part of the Pulse system responsible for generating worldstates.
    *   **Output:** It produces `.jsonl` files (e.g., `history_logs/vars_{run_id}.jsonl`). These files serve as a data interface for other modules that might perform analysis, visualization, or feed into other learning processes.
*   **Input/Output Files:**
    *   **Input:** None directly read from the filesystem by this module, but it processes in-memory `state_snapshots` data.
    *   **Output:** Log files in JSONL format, typically `history_logs/vars_{run_id}.jsonl`, as specified by the `output_dir` parameter and internal naming logic ([`line 33`](learning/history_tracker.py:33)).

## 5. Function and Class Example Usages

The module contains one primary function, [`track_variable_history()`](learning/history_tracker.py:19).

**`track_variable_history(run_id: str, state_snapshots: List[Dict], output_dir: str = "history_logs") -> None`**

*   **Purpose:** Saves the history of variables from a series of simulation state snapshots to a JSONL file.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `run_id (str)`: A unique identifier for the simulation run. This is used in the output filename.
    *   `state_snapshots (List[Dict])`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a full worldstate at a specific simulation step, ordered temporally. Each snapshot is expected to contain a key `"variables"` which holds another dictionary of variable states.
    *   `output_dir (str)`: The directory where the log file will be saved. Defaults to `"history_logs"`.
*   **Usage Example (from module docstring):**
    ```python
    from analytics.history_tracker import track_variable_history

    # Assuming 'simulation_run_id' is a string and 'snapshots_data' is a list of dicts
    track_variable_history(run_id=simulation_run_id, state_snapshots=snapshots_data)
    # This would create a file like 'history_logs/vars_simulation_run_id.jsonl'
    ```

## 6. Hardcoding Issues

*   **Default Output Directory:** The default value for the `output_dir` parameter in the [`track_variable_history()`](learning/history_tracker.py:19) function is hardcoded to `"history_logs"`.
*   **Log File Prefix:** The prefix `"vars_"` for the output log file is hardcoded within the path construction logic: [`f"vars_{run_id}.jsonl"`](learning/history_tracker.py:33).
*   **Warning/Error Messages:** Informational, warning, and error messages are hardcoded strings printed directly to the console (e.g., [`"⚠️ Warning: Step {i} is not a valid dictionary. Skipping."`](learning/history_tracker.py:39), [`"✅ Variable history saved to {path}"`](learning/history_tracker.py:53)).
*   **Dictionary Keys:** The code explicitly looks for a `"variables"` key within each snapshot dictionary ([`snapshot.get("variables")`](learning/history_tracker.py:41)). If this key name changes in the input data structure, the module will fail to extract data correctly.

## 7. Coupling Points

*   **Input Data Structure:** The module is tightly coupled to the expected structure of the `state_snapshots` input. It specifically expects a list of dictionaries, and each dictionary must contain a key named `"variables"` whose value is also a dictionary. Any deviation from this structure in the data provided by the calling module (e.g., a simulation engine) will lead to errors or incorrect behavior.
*   **Output File Format:** The module produces JSONL files with a specific structure for each line (a JSON object with `"step"` and `"variables"` keys). Any downstream tools or modules that consume these files will be coupled to this format.
*   **Filesystem Interaction:** The module directly interacts with the filesystem to create directories and write files. Its behavior is dependent on filesystem permissions and path validity.

## 8. Existing Tests

A test file [`tests/test_history_tracker.py`](tests/test_history_tracker.py:) exists in the project structure, suggesting that unit tests are available for this module. The specifics of test coverage and quality would require examination of that file's content.

## 9. Module Architecture and Flow

*   **Structure:** The module is simple, containing one public function, [`track_variable_history()`](learning/history_tracker.py:19).
*   **Data/Control Flow:**
    1.  The [`track_variable_history()`](learning/history_tracker.py:19) function is called with a `run_id`, a list of `state_snapshots`, and an optional `output_dir`.
    2.  The `run_id` is sanitized using [`os.path.basename()`](learning/history_tracker.py:31) to prevent directory traversal issues.
    3.  The specified `output_dir` is created if it doesn't already exist using [`os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)`](learning/history_tracker.py:32).
    4.  The full output file path is constructed (e.g., `output_dir/vars_{run_id}.jsonl`).
    5.  The function attempts to open this file in write mode (`"w"`).
    6.  It iterates through the `state_snapshots` list using `enumerate` to get both the index (step number) and the snapshot data.
    7.  For each `snapshot`:
        *   It checks if the `snapshot` is a dictionary. If not, a warning is printed, and the snapshot is skipped ([`line 38-40`](learning/history_tracker.py:38-40)).
        *   It attempts to retrieve the `variables` dictionary from the `snapshot`. If missing or not a dictionary, a warning is printed, and the snapshot is skipped ([`line 41-44`](learning/history_tracker.py:41-44)).
        *   A `record` dictionary is created containing the current `step` (index) and the extracted `variables`.
        *   This `record` is serialized to a JSON string using [`json.dumps()`](learning/history_tracker.py:50) and written to the output file, followed by a newline character, creating the JSONL format.
        *   A `TypeError` during serialization is caught, and a warning is printed ([`line 51-52`](learning/history_tracker.py:51-52)).
    8.  After processing all snapshots, a success message with the file path is printed.
    9.  Any general `Exception` during the file writing process is caught, and an error message is printed.

## 10. Naming Conventions

*   **Module Name:** `history_tracker.py` follows Python's snake_case convention for module names and is descriptive.
*   **Function Name:** [`track_variable_history`](learning/history_tracker.py:19) uses snake_case and clearly describes its action.
*   **Variable Names:** Variables like `run_id`, `state_snapshots`, `output_dir`, `path`, `snapshot`, `variables`, `record` are generally clear, use snake_case, and are appropriate for their context.
*   **Consistency:** Naming appears consistent within the module and generally adheres to PEP 8 guidelines. No obvious deviations or potential AI assumption errors in naming were noted.
