| `` `symbolic_system/symbolic_flip_classifier.py` `` | Description: The module analyzes sequences of forecast "chains" to identify and classify transitions in symbolic "arcs" and "tags," detecting common patterns and cyclical behaviors. Major Gap: The module's docstring mentions identifying "Repair-resistant patterns for operator review," but there isn't an explicit function for this. Current loop detection is simple (A->B->A) and doesn't handle more complex cycles. | [`Link`](docs/sprint0_module_analysis/symbolic_system_symbolic_flip_classifier_py.md) |
| `` `symbolic_system/symbolic_memory.py` `` | Description: The module tracks and logs symbolic overlay states across different turns within each simulation for downstream symbolic analysis.

| `` `trust_system/pulse_regret_chain.py` `` | This module manages a persistent log of "regret events" within the trust system, such as forecast errors or symbolic contradictions. It provides functionalities to record new events, retrieve the entire chain of regrets, update the review status of events, and generate summaries and scores based on the logged data. A command-line interface allows for direct interaction with the regret chain. | [Link](docs/trust_system_pulse_regret_chain_py.md) |
| `` `trust_system/recovered_forecast_scorer.py` `` | This module re-evaluates forecasts that have been "recovered," likely through a process like symbolic sweep or other corrective measures. It annotates these forecasts with updated trust and license metadata, flags those that remain unstable based on criteria like low alignment or drift, summarizes the quality of the repair process, and allows for exporting flagged forecasts for further review or revision. | [Link](docs/trust_system_recovered_forecast_scorer_py.md) |
| `` `trust_system/retrodiction_engine.py` `` | This module serves as a wrapper for running retrodiction simulations. It utilizes the unified \`simulate_forward\` function from \`engine.simulator_core\` by setting it to "retrodiction mode." The module handles the results of these simulations, providing functions to save them to a persistent \`ForecastMemory\` instance, ensuring that complex objects like overlays are properly serialized. It also includes a utility to save individual forecast objects. | [Link](docs/trust_system_retrodiction_engine_py.md) |
| `` `trust_system/rule_adjustment.py` `` | This module is responsible for dynamically adjusting the trust weights of rules and symbolic tags based on a "learning profile." It analyzes performance metrics (like win rates) for symbolic arcs and tags, and then upgrades or downgrades their associated trust scores in the \`RuleRegistry\` and \`VariableRegistry\`. This allows the system to adapt its confidence in different rules and symbolic concepts over time based on their observed effectiveness. | [Link](docs/trust_system_rule_adjustment_py.md) |
| `` `trust_system/services/trust_enrichment_service.py` `` | This module defines a service (\`TrustEnrichmentService\`) responsible for augmenting forecast objects with various trust-related metadata. It acts as an orchestrator, calling a series of private helper functions (imported from \`trust_system.trust_engine\`) to add information such as fragility scores, retrodiction errors, alignment scores, attention scores, regret linkage, and license status to a given forecast. It also supports a plugin architecture for custom enrichment steps. | [Link](docs/trust_system_services_trust_enrichment_service_py.md) |
| `` `trust_system/services/trust_scoring_strategy.py` `` | This module defines a strategy pattern for calculating trust scores for forecasts. It includes an abstract base class `TrustScoringStrategy` and a `DefaultTrustScoringStrategy` that computes a forecast's confidence by considering factors like capital movement, risk, historical consistency, novelty, and symbolic drift. | [Link](docs/trust_system_services_trust_scoring_strategy_py.md) |
| `` `trust_system/symbolic_bandit_agent.py` `` | This module implements a simple Epsilon-Greedy multi-armed bandit agent. It's designed to select actions to maximize rewards over time by balancing exploration (random action) and exploitation (choosing the action with the current highest estimated value). The \"Symbolic\" part of its name suggests it's intended for use in contexts involving symbolic reasoning or choices, though the current implementation is a generic bandit agent. | [Link](docs/trust_system_symbolic_bandit_agent_py.md) |
| `` `trust_system/trust_engine.py` `` | This module serves as the central engine for evaluating and managing trust in forecasts within the Pulse system. It integrates various sub-systems and functionalities, including symbolic tagging, confidence scoring (delegated to strategies like `DefaultTrustScoringStrategy`), risk assessment, contradiction detection, lineage tracking, and metadata enrichment. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools to assess, label, and audit forecasts, aiming to ensure their reliability and coherence for downstream decision-making processes. The engine is designed with extensibility in mind, featuring a plugin system for trust enrichment and a strategy pattern for scoring. | [Link](docs/trust_system_trust_engine_py.md) |
| `` `trust_system/trust_update.py` `` | This module is responsible for adjusting the trust weights of historical forecasts stored in the \"PFPA (Past Forecast Performance Archive) memory.\" It uses retrodiction scores (how well a past forecast would have predicted actual outcomes) to modify the original confidence of these forecasts. Forecasts with high retrodiction scores get their trust weights boosted, while those with low scores are penalized. The module also includes a plugin system for custom actions after weights are updated and a simple inline test. | [Link](docs/trust_system_trust_update_py.md) |
| `` `trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py` `` | This module implements an `UpgradeGatekeeper` class responsible for managing the approval process of \"epistemic/symbolic upgrades\" within the Pulse system. It loads pending upgrade proposals from a specified sandbox directory (as JSONL files), scores them using a currently simplified heuristic, and then either approves them (writing to an approved upgrades file) or quarantines them based on a configurable trust threshold. It also provides a method to retrieve all approved upgrades, presumably for subsequent application to the system. | [Link](docs/trust_system_upgrade_gatekeeper_py.md) |
| `` `trust_system/upgrade_gatekeeper.py` `` | Description: Manages the approval process of epistemic/symbolic upgrades by loading, scoring (currently simplified), and then approving or quarantining them based on a trust threshold. Main Gap: The primary gap is the simplified `score_upgrade` method, which needs to be replaced or enhanced with a robust trust evaluation mechanism, likely by integrating the planned `evaluate_upgrade_trust_score` from the TrustEngine. | [`Link`](docs/trust_system_upgrade_gatekeeper_py.md) |
