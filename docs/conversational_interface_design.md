# Conversational Interface Architecture and Interaction Flow for Pulse

## 1. High-Level Architecture

The conversational interface for Pulse will follow a modular architecture to handle natural language input, interact with Pulse's core functionalities, and provide relevant outputs. The high-level architecture will consist of the following layers:

*   **Presentation Layer:** The single-window ChatGPT-like interface where users input natural language queries and receive responses.
*   **Interface Layer:** This layer acts as the entry point for user requests. It receives the natural language input from the Presentation Layer.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Layer:** This layer is responsible for understanding the user's intent and extracting relevant information (entities, parameters) from the natural language input. It will likely leverage external AI APIs for this purpose.
*   **Orchestration Layer:** This is the core of the conversational interface. It receives the processed intent and parameters from the NLP Layer and determines which Pulse module(s) or external service(s) need to be invoked to fulfill the request. It manages the workflow and coordinates interactions between different components.
*   **Pulse Modules:** This layer represents the existing Pulse functionalities (Forecast Engine, Simulation Engine, Data Access, etc.) that the conversational interface will interact with.
*   **External Services Layer:** This includes external AI APIs for NLP, interpretation, and generation, as well as any other external services required (e.g., data sources if not accessed via Pulse's existing data access).
*   **Output Formatting Layer:** This layer takes the results from the Pulse Modules or External Services and formats them into a human-readable, conversational response for the Presentation Layer.

```

## 2. Key Components

*   **Input Handler:** Receives raw text input from the user interface.
*   **Intent Recognizer:** Analyzes the input text to determine the user's goal (e.g., get forecast, run simulation, explain data). This will likely use machine learning models, potentially hosted via an external AI API.
*   **Entity Extractor:** Identifies and extracts key information from the input, such as stock tickers (NVDA), simulation parameters, date ranges, etc. This component will work closely with the Intent Recognizer.
*   **Request Router:** Based on the identified intent and extracted entities, this component routes the request to the appropriate Pulse module or external service.
*   **Pulse Module Adapters:** These components act as intermediaries between the Orchestration Layer and the specific Pulse Modules. They translate the standardized requests from the Orchestration Layer into the specific API calls or function calls required by each Pulse module.
*   **AI API Connector:** Handles communication with external AI APIs for NLP tasks (intent recognition, entity extraction) and potentially for generating conversational responses or interpreting results.
*   **Response Synthesizer:** Gathers results from the invoked Pulse Modules or External Services.
*   **Output Formatter:** Structures the gathered results into a clear, concise, and conversational response suitable for the user interface. This might involve generating natural language summaries, tables, or visualizations.
*   **State Manager:** (Optional but recommended) Maintains context across a conversation, allowing for follow-up questions and multi-turn interactions.

## 3. Interaction Flow for Typical User Requests

The interaction flow will generally follow these steps:

1.  **User Input:** The user types a natural language request into the interface (e.g., "Show me the forecast for NVDA").
2.  **Input Handling:** The Input Handler receives the raw text.
3.  **NLP Processing:** The Intent Recognizer identifies the intent ("get forecast") and the Entity Extractor identifies the entity ("NVDA").
4.  **Request Routing:** The Request Router directs the request to the appropriate Pulse Module Adapter (e.g., Forecast Engine Adapter).
5.  **Pulse Module Interaction:** The Forecast Engine Adapter translates the request and calls the Pulse Forecast Engine with the specified parameters (e.g., get forecast for ticker "NVDA").
6.  **Result Retrieval:** The Forecast Engine processes the request and returns the forecast data to the Forecast Engine Adapter.
7.  **Response Synthesis:** The Response Synthesizer receives the forecast data.
8.  **Output Formatting:** The Output Formatter structures the forecast data into a conversational response (e.g., "Here is the forecast for NVDA: [formatted forecast data]").
9.  **Presentation:** The formatted response is displayed to the user in the interface.

**Example: "Run a simulation with these parameters"**

1.  User Input: "Run a simulation with these parameters: [list of parameters]"
2.  Input Handling: Receives input.
3.  NLP Processing: Intent Recognizer identifies "run simulation", Entity Extractor extracts parameters.
4.  Request Routing: Routes to Simulation Engine Adapter.
5.  Pulse Module Interaction: Simulation Engine Adapter calls the Pulse Simulation Engine with parameters.
6.  Result Retrieval: Simulation Engine runs and returns results.
7.  Response Synthesis: Gathers simulation results.
8.  Output Formatting: Formats results into a conversational summary or visualization.
9.  Presentation: Displays formatted results.

**Example: "Explain this forecast" (assuming a previous forecast is displayed)**

1.  User Input: "Explain this forecast"
2.  Input Handling: Receives input.
3.  NLP Processing: Intent Recognizer identifies "explain forecast". The State Manager (if implemented) provides context about the previous forecast.
4.  Request Routing: Routes to AI API Connector for interpretation.
5.  External Service Interaction: AI API Connector sends the forecast data (from context) and the request to an external AI API for explanation.
6.  Result Retrieval: The external AI API returns a natural language explanation.
7.  Response Synthesis: Gathers the explanation.
8.  Output Formatting: Formats the explanation for display.
9.  Presentation: Displays the explanation.

## 4. Leveraging Existing Pulse Modules and External AI APIs

*   **Pulse Modules:** The Orchestration Layer and specific Module Adapters will be responsible for interacting with existing Pulse modules. This involves understanding the APIs or interfaces of modules like:
    *   **Forecast Engine:** To request forecasts for specific symbols or parameters.
    *   **Data Access (via plugins):** To retrieve historical or real-time data.
    *   **Simulation Engine:** To run simulations with specified parameters.
    *   **Trust Engine:** To get trust scores for forecasts or data.
    *   **Memory/Diagnostics:** To access historical data, logs, or system state.
    *   **Symbolic System:** Potentially to query rules or system patterns.
*   **External AI APIs:** These will be primarily used for:
    *   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Intent recognition and entity extraction. Services like OpenAI's API, Google Cloud Natural Language, or similar can be used.
    *   **Natural Language Generation (NLG):** Generating conversational responses, summaries, and explanations.
    *   **Interpretation:** Analyzing Pulse outputs (like forecasts or simulation results) and providing natural language interpretations.

The AI API Connector component will manage the communication, authentication, and request/response formatting for these external services.

## 5. Design Detail for Implementation

The design provides a clear breakdown of the architectural layers and key components. For implementation by the `code` mode, the following would be the next steps informed by this design:

*   Define clear API specifications or interfaces for the interactions between the Orchestration Layer and the Pulse Module Adapters.
*   Implement the core Orchestration Layer logic for routing requests based on intent and entities.
*   Develop the NLP Layer components (Intent Recognizer, Entity Extractor), potentially integrating with a chosen external AI API.
*   Implement the Pulse Module Adapters for the key functionalities identified (Forecast, Simulation, Data Access).
*   Develop the AI API Connector for communication with external AI services.
*   Implement the Output Formatting Layer to present results effectively.
*   Consider implementing the optional State Manager for conversational context.
*   Define the data structures for representing intents, entities, requests, and responses.

This design provides a solid foundation for the `code` mode to begin implementing the conversational interface, focusing on the interactions between the defined components and leveraging the existing Pulse modules.
