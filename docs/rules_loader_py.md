# Module Analysis: `rules/loader.py`

## 1. Module Intent/Purpose

The module [`rules/loader.py`](rules/loader.py) is responsible for loading causal rule definitions from YAML files and transforming them into Pydantic `Rule` objects as defined in [`rules/schemas.py`](rules/schemas.py). This allows rules to be defined externally in a human-readable format and then be validated and used by the rule engine.

## 2. Key Functionalities

*   **`load_rules_from_yaml(file_path: Path) -> list[Rule]`**:
    *   Reads a specified YAML file.
    *   Parses the YAML content.
    *   For each rule definition in the YAML, it attempts to instantiate a `rules.schemas.Rule` Pydantic model.
    *   Performs validation via Pydantic during instantiation.
    *   Returns a list of valid `Rule` objects.
*   May include helper functions for traversing directories to find all rule YAML files (e.g., in `rules/definitions/`).

## 3. Operational Status/Completeness

This module is newly introduced in Pulse v0.10. Its functionalities will be developed as part of this version.

## 4. Connections & Dependencies

*   **`rules.schemas.Rule`**: The target Pydantic model for deserialization.
*   **PyYAML (or a similar YAML parsing library)**: For reading and parsing YAML files.
*   **Pydantic**: For data validation and model instantiation.
*   **`pathlib`**: For file system path operations.
*   **`engine.rules.rule_registry`**: The `RuleRegistry` will likely use this loader to populate its collection of rules from YAML files.
