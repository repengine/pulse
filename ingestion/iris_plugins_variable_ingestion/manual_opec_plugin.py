"""Manual OPEC Data Plugin.

Reads and processes historical OPEC crude oil price data from a local zip file.

This plugin ingests the OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) price data from a locally stored
zip file (QDL_OPEC_7f41729ade733436c2dc493d282cef69.zip) rather than attempting to
fetch it from the Nasdaq Data Link API.

The plugin:
1. Looks for the zip file in the data/manual_bulk_data directory
2. Extracts and processes any CSV files contained in the zip
3. Creates signals with the name "orb_price" that will be available to the Pulse system
4. Saves processed data to disk for future reference

This approach provides a reliable alternative to API-based ingestion, especially
when the original data source is no longer accessible or requires credentials.

Requires:
- The QDL_OPEC_7f41729ade733436c2dc493d282cef69.zip file in data/manual_bulk_data/
