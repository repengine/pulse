"""
Symbolic Gravity System Module

This module implements the Symbolic Gravity Fabric system, which acts as a
corrective layer between the causal simulation and observed reality.

Key components:
- SymbolicPillars: Vertical data structures that grow/shrink based on data
- ResidualGravityEngine: Learns relationships between pillars and simulation errors
- SymbolicGravityFabric: Connects pillars to simulation to apply corrections

The system uses symbolic pillars to support a gravity fabric that corrects
forecast outputs by pulling them toward observed reality.
